The relocation of a building will automatically cause an inspection and evaluation process that enables the jurisdiction to determine the level of compliance with the International Fire Code\u00ae and the International Property Maintenance Code\u00ae. These two codes, by their scope, are applicable to existing buildings. This is the case regardless of any repair, remodeling, alteration work or change of occupancy occurring (see the International Fire Code and International Property Maintenance Code)."}
