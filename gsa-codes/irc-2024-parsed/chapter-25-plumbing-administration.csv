25,,Plumbing Administration,User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 25 covers regulations for existing plumbing installations and testing of new or repaired systems. These general requirements can be superseded by more specific requirements for certain applications in Chapters 26 through 33.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
P2501,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,General,
P2501.1,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Scope,The provisions of this chapter shall establish the general administrative requirements applicable to plumbing systems and inspection requirements of this code.
P2501.2,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Application,"In addition to the general administration requirements of Chapter 1, the administrative provisions of this chapter shall apply to the plumbing requirements of Chapters 25 through 33."
P2502,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Existing Plumbing Systems,
P2502.1,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Existing Building Sewers and Building Drains,"Where the entire sanitary drainage system of an existing building is replaced, existing building drains under concrete slabs and existing building sewers that will serve the new system shall be internally examined to verify that the piping is sloping in the correct direction, is not broken, is not obstructed and is sized for the drainage load of the new plumbing drainage system to be installed."
P2502.2,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,"Additions, Alterations or Repairs","Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs to any plumbing system shall conform to that required for a new plumbing system without requiring the existing plumbing system to comply with the requirements of this code. Additions, alterations or repairs shall not cause an existing system to become unsafe, insanitary or overloaded.Minor additions, alterations, renovations and repairs to existing plumbing systems shall be permitted in the same manner and arrangement as in the existing system, provided that such repairs or replacement are not hazardous and are approved."
P2503,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Inspection and Tests,
P2503.1,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Inspection Required,New plumbing work and parts of existing systems affected by new work or alterations shall be inspected by the building official to ensure compliance with the requirements of this code.
P2503.2,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Concealment,"A plumbing or drainage system, or part thereof, shall not be covered, concealed or put into use until it has been tested, inspected and approved by the building official."
P2503.3,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Responsibility of Permittee,"Test equipment, materials and labor shall be furnished by the permittee."
P2503.4,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Building Sewer Testing,"The building sewer shall be tested by insertion of a test plug at the point of connection with the public sewer, filling the building sewer with water and pressurizing the sewer to not less than a 10-foot (3048 mm) head of water. The test pressure shall not decrease during a period of not less than 15 minutes. The building sewer shall be watertight at all points.A forced sewer test shall consist of pressurizing the piping to a pressure of not less than 5 psi (34.5 kPa) greater than the pump rating and maintaining such pressure for not less than 15 minutes. The forced sewer shall be watertight at all points."
P2503.5,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,"Drain, Waste and Vent Systems Testing","Rough-in and finished plumbing installations of drain, waste and vent systems shall be tested in accordance with Sections P2503.5.1 and P2503.5.2."
P2503.5.1,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Rough Plumbing,"DWV systems shall be tested on completion of the rough piping installation by water, by air for piping systems other than plastic, or by a vacuum of air for plastic piping systems, without evidence of leakage. The test shall be applied to the drainage system in its entirety or in sections after rough-in piping has been installed, as follows:Water test. Each section shall be filled with water to a point not less than 10 feet (3048 mm) above the highest fitting connection in that section, or to the highest point in the completed system. Water shall be held in the section under test for a period of 15 minutes. The system shall prove leak free by visual inspection.Air test. The portion under test shall be maintained at a gauge pressure of 5 pounds per square inch (psi) (34 kPa) or 10 inches of mercury column (34 kPa). This pressure shall be held without introduction of additional air for a period of 15 minutes.Vacuum test. The portion under test shall be evacuated of air by a vacuum-type pump to achieve a uniform gauge pressure of -5 pounds per square inch or a negative 10 inches of mercury column (-34 kPa). This pressure shall be held without the removal of additional air for a period of 15 minutes."
P2503.5.2,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Drainage and Vent Final Test,The final test of the drainage and vent system shall be visual to determine compliance with the provision of this code. Each fixture shall be filled and then drained. Traps and fixture connections shall be proven watertight.
P2503.6,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Shower Liner Test,"Where shower floors and receptors are made watertight by the application of materials required by Section P2709.2, the completed liner installation shall be tested. The pipe from the shower drain shall be plugged watertight for the test. The floor and receptor area shall be filled with potable water to a depth of not less than 2 inches (51 mm) measured at the threshold. Where a threshold of not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in height does not exist, a temporary threshold shall be constructed to retain the test water in the lined floor or receptor area to a level not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in depth measured at the threshold. The water shall be retained for a test period of not less than 15 minutes and there shall not be evidence of leakage."
P2503.7,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Water-Supply System Testing,"Upon completion of the water-supply system or a section of it, the system or portion completed shall be tested and proved tight under a water pressure of not less than the working pressure of the system or, for piping systems other than plastic, by an air test of not less than 50 psi (345 kPa). This pressure shall be held for not less than 15 minutes. The water used for tests shall be obtained from a potable water source.Exception: For PEX piping systems, testing with a compressed gas shall be an alternative to hydrostatic testing where compressed air or other gas pressure testing is specifically authorized by the manufacturer's instructions for the PEX pipe and fittings products installed at the time the system is being tested, and compressed air or other gas testing is not otherwise prohibited by applicable codes, laws or regulations outside of this code."
P2503.8,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Inspection and Testing of Backflow Prevention Devices,Inspection and testing of backflow prevention devices shall comply with Sections P2503.8.1 and P2503.8.2.
P2503.8.1,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Inspections,Inspections shall be made of backflow prevention assemblies to determine whether they are operable.
P2503.8.2,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Testing,"Reduced pressure principle, double check, double check detector and pressure vacuum breaker backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested at the time of installation, immediately after repairs or relocation and every year thereafter."
P2503.9,Chapter 25 Plumbing Administration,Test Gauges,Gauges used for testing shall be as follows:Tests requiring a pressure of 10 psi or less shall utilize a testing gauge having increments of 0.10 psi (0.69 kPa) or less.Tests requiring a pressure higher than 10 psi (0.69 kPa) but less than or equal to 100 psi (690 kPa) shall use a testing gauge having increments of 1 psi (6.9 kPa) or less.Tests requiring a pressure higher than 100 psi (690 kPa) shall use a testing gauge having increments of 2 psi (14 kPa) or less.
