The effective wind area shall be equal to the span length multiplied by an effective width. This width shall be not less than one-third the span length. For cladding fasteners, the effective wind areas shall not be greater than the area that is tributary to an individual fastener. For effective areas between those given, the load shall be interpolated or the load associated with the lower effective areas shall be used. Table values shall be adjusted for height and exposure by multiplying by the adjustment coefficient in Table R301.2.1(2). See Figure R301.2.1 for locations of zones. Plus and minus signs signify pressures acting toward and away from the building surfaces. Positive and negative design wind pressures shall not be less than 10 psf. Roof overhang loads shall be determined by summing the applicable roof zone pressure with the adjacent wall zone pressure.
