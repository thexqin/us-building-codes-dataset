A roof assembly includes the roof deck, substrate or thermal barrier, insulation, vapor retarder and roof covering. This chapter provides the requirement for wind resistance of roof coverings. The types of roof covering materials and installation addressed by Chapter 9 are: asphalt shingles, clay and concrete tile, metal roof shingles, mineral-surfaced roll roofing, slate and slate-type shingles, wood shakes and shingles, built-up roofs, metal roof panels, modified bitumen roofing, thermoset and thermoplastic single-ply roofing, sprayed polyurethane foam roofing, liquid applied coatings and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof coverings. Chapter 9 also provides requirements for roof drainage, flashing, above-deck thermal insulation, rooftop-mounted photovoltaic systems and recovering or replacing an existing roof covering."}
