Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1\u2014Scope and Application (Sections R101\u2014R102) and Part 2\u2014Administration and Enforcement (Sections R103\u2014R114). Section R101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable. Standards and codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section R102.4).The one- and two-family dwelling code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document, and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the building official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner.QR code use: A QR code is placed at the beginning of any section that has undergone technical revision.
