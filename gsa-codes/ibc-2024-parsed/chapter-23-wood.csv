,,23,Chapter 23 Wood,0,"User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 23 provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and structures that use wood and wood-based products. The chapter is organized around three design methodologies: allowable stress design (ASD), load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and conventional light-frame construction. In addition it allows the use of the American Wood Council Wood Frame Construction Manual for a limited range of structures. Included in the chapter are references to design and manufacturing standards for various wood and wood-based products; general construction requirements; design criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for the application of the three design methods. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."

Rafter tie heel joint connections are not required where the ridge is supported by a load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam. Where intermediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements are permitted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span. Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joist to ceiling joist lap splices. Connected members shall be of sufficient size to prevent splitting due to nailing. For allowable stress designs now loads less than 30 pounds per square foot, the required number of nails is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the ratio of actual snow load plus 10 divided by 40, but not less than the number required for no snow load. Applies to roof live load of 20 psf or less. Tabulated heel joint connection requirements assume that ceiling joists or rafter ties are located at the bottom of the attic space. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic, heel joint connection requirements shall be increased by the adjustment factors in Table 2308.11.3.1(1). Tabulated requirements are based on 10 psf roof dead load in combination with the specified roof snow load and roof live load.

The uplift connection requirements are based on a 33-foot mean roof height. The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 16 inches on center and multiply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center. The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load. The uplift connection requirements include for the effects of 24-inch overhangs. The uplift connection requirements are based on wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.3-1 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the corner of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection value by 0.75. For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down). Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of V and roof spans. The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications. The required rating of approved uplift connectors is based on allowable stress design loads. V shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3."
