Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified. The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 is subdivided into four main sections: general (Sections 1003\u20141015), exit access (Sections 1016\u20141021), exit (Sections 1022\u20141027) and exit discharge (Sections 1028\u20141029). Special allowances for the unique requirements for assembly spaces (Section 1030) and emergency escape and rescue openings (Section 1031) complete the chapter. Chapter 10 of this code is duplicated in Chapter 10 the International Fire Code\u00ae; however, the International Fire Code contains one additional section on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings."}

The open-ended corridors comply with Section 1020.3.3. The open-ended corridors are connected on each end to an exterior exit stairway or ramp complying with Section 1027.3.4. The exterior walls and openings adjacent to the exterior exit stairway or ramp comply with Section 1023.7.3.5. At any location in an open-ended corridor where a change of direction exceeding 45 degrees (0.79 rad) occurs, a clear opening of not less than 35 square feet (3.3 m2) or an exterior stairway or ramp shall be provided. Where clear openings are provided, they shall be located so as to minimize the accumulation of smoke or toxic gases.In Group R-3 occupancies not more than four stories in height, exterior exit stairways and ramps serving individual dwelling units are not required to be separated from the interior of the building where the exterior exit stairway or ramp discharges directly to grade."}
