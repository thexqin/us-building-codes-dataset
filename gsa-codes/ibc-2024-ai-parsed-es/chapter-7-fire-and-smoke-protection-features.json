Staples with equivalent holding power and penetration shall be permitted to be used as alternate fasteners to nails for attachment to wood framing. Thickness shown for brick and clay tile is nominal thicknesses unless plastered, in which case thicknesses are net. Thickness shown for concrete masonry and clay masonry is equivalent thickness defined in Section 722.3.1 for concrete masonry and Section 722.4.1.1 for clay masonry. Where all cells are solid grouted or filled with silicone-treated perlite loose-fill insulation; vermiculite loose-fill insulation; or expanded clay, shale or slate lightweight aggregate, the equivalent thickness shall be the thickness of the block or brick using specified dimensions as defined in Chapter 21. Equivalent thickness shall include the thickness of applied plaster and lath or gypsum wallboard, where specified. For units in which the net cross-sectional area of cored brick in any plane parallel to the surface containing the cores is not less than 75 percent of the gross cross-sectional area measured in the same plane. Shall be used for nonbearing purposes only. For all of the construction with gypsum wallboard described in this table, gypsum base for veneer plaster of the same size, thickness and core type shall be permitted to be substituted for gypsum wallboard, provided that attachment is identical to that specified for the wallboard, and the joints on the face layer are reinforced and the entire surface is covered with not less than 1/16-inch gypsum veneer plaster. The fire-resistance time period for concrete masonry units meeting the equivalent thicknesses required for a 2-hour fire-resistance rating in Item 3, and having a thickness of not less than 7 5/8 inches is 4 hours where cores that are not grouted are filled with silicone-treated perlite loose-fill insulation; vermiculite loose-fill insulation; or expanded clay, shale or slate lightweight aggregate, sand or slag having a maximum particle size of 3/8 inch. The fire-resistance rating of concrete masonry units composed of a combination of aggregate types or where plaster is applied directly to the concrete masonry shall be determined in accordance with ACI 216.1/TMS 216. Lightweight aggregates shall have a maximum combined density of 65 pounds per cubic foot. See Note b. The equivalent thickness shall be permitted to include the thickness of cement plaster or 1.5 times the thickness of gypsum plaster applied in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 25. Concrete walls shall be reinforced with horizontal and vertical temperature reinforcement as required by Chapter 19. Studs are welded truss wire studs with 0.18 inch (No. 7 B.W. gage) flange wire and 0.18 inch (No. 7 B.W. gage) truss wires. Nailable metal studs consist of two channel studs spot welded back to back with a crimped web forming a nailing groove. Wood structural panels shall be permitted to be installed between the fire protection and the wood studs on either the interior or exterior side of the wood frame assemblies in this table, provided that the length of the fasteners used to attach the fire protection is increased by an amount not less than the thickness of the wood structural panel. For studs with a slenderness ratio, le/d, greater than 33, the design stress shall be reduced to 78 percent of allowable F'c. For studs with a slenderness ratio, le/d, not exceeding 33, the design stress shall be reduced to 78 percent of the adjusted stress F' c calculated for studs having a slenderness ratio le/d of 33. For properties of cooler or wallboard nails, see ASTM C514, ASTM C547 or ASTM F1667. Generic fire-resistance ratings (those not designated as PROPRIETARY* in the listing) in the GA-600 shall be accepted as if herein specified.
