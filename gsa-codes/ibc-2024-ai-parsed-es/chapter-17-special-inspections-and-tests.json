Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To determine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC\u2014Fire Safety Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. Sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by the IBC\u2014Structural Code Development Committee during the Group B cycle."}

For components that carry dynamic loads (for example, machine supports or fall arrest anchors), the load shall be left in place for a period consistent with the component's actual function. The structure shall be considered to have successfully met the test requirements where the following criteria are satisfied:Under the design load, the deflection shall not exceed the limitations specified in Section 1604.3.Within 24 hours after removal of the test load, the structure shall have recovered not less than 75 percent of the maximum deflection.During and immediately after the test, the structure shall not show evidence of failure."}
