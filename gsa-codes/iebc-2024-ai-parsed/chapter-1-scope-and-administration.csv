Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Administration (Sections 101—102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103—117). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes®as applicable.This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document, and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the registered design professional, contractor and property owner.Section 104 was revised for the 2024 edition.
