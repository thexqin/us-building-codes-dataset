Additionally, the code provides jurisdictions with optional supplemental requirements, including requirements that lead to achievement of zero energy buildings, presently, and, through glide paths that achieve zero energy buildings by 2030 and on additional timelines sought by governments, and achievement of additional policy goals as identified by the Energy and Carbon Advisory Council and approved by the Board of Directors. The code may include nonmandatory appendices incorporating additional energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction resources developed by the International Code Council and others. Requirements contained in the code will include, but not be limited to, prescriptive- and performance-based pathways. The code will aim to simplify code requirements to facilitate the code's use and compliance rate. The code is updated on a 3-year cycle with each subsequent edition providing increased energy savings over the prior edition. The IECC residential provisions shall include an update to Chapter 11 of this code. This code is intended to provide flexibility to permit the use of innovative approaches and techniques to achieve this intent. This code is not intended to abridge safety, health or environmental requirements contained in other applicable codes or ordinances."

Determine the thermal climate zone, 0 through 8, from Table N1101.7.2 using the heating (HDD) and cooling degree-days (CDD) for the location. Determine the moisture zone (Marine, Dry or Humid) in accordance with Items 2.1 through 2.3. If monthly average temperature and precipitation data are available, use the Marine, Dry and Humid definitions to determine the moisture zone (C, B or A). If annual average temperature information (including degree-days) and annual precipitation (i.e., annual mean) are available, use Items 2.2.1 through 2.2.3 to determine the moisture zone. If the moisture zone is not Marine, then use the Dry definition to determine whether Dry or Humid. If thermal climate zone is 3 and CDD50°F ≤ 4,500 (CDD10°C ≤ 2500), climate zone is Marine (3C). If thermal climate zone is 4 and CDD50°F ≤ 2,700 (CDD10°C ≤ 1500), climate zone is Marine (4C). If thermal climate zone is 5 and CDD50°F ≤ 1,800 (CDD10°C ≤ 1000), climate zone is Marine (5C). If only degree-day information is available, use Items 2.3.1 through 2.3.3 to determine the moisture zone. If the moisture zone is not Marine, then it is not possible to assign Humid or Dry moisture zone for this location. If thermal climate zone is 3 and CDD50°F ≤ 4,500 (CDD10°C ≤ 2500), climate zone is Marine (3C). If thermal climate zone is 4 and CDD50°F ≤ 2,700 (CDD10°C ≤ 1500), climate zone is Marine (4C).
