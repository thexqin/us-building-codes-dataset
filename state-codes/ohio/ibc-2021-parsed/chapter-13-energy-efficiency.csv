13,,Energy Efficiency,"User notes:About this chapter: The purpose of Chapter 13 is to provide minimum design requirements that will promote efficient energy utilization in buildings. The requirements address the building thermal envelope, the selection of HVAC and lighting equipment, and the installation of controls that dictate efficient operation. Also promoted is efficient use of power where providing water and lighting to the users of the space.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the International Energy Conservation Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."
