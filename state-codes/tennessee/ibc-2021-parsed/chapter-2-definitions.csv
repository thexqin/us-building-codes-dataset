Every word, term and punctuation mark can add to or change the meaning of a technical requirement. It is necessary to maintain a consensus on the specific meaning of each term contained in the code. Chapter 2 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purposes of the code. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [A] or [BS] will be considered by one of the code development committees meeting during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."
