,,24,Chapter 24 Glass and Glazing,0,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 24 establishes regulations for glass and glazing used in buildings and structures. Engineering and design requirements are included in the chapter for glazing that is subjected to wind and snow loads. Another concern of this chapter is glass and glazing used in areas where it is likely to be impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing must either be safety glazing or protected to prevent impacts by occupants. Safety glazing must meet stringent standards and be appropriately marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for glass and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as well as in athletic facilities.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."
