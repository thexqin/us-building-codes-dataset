,,16,Chapter 16 Structural Design,0,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 16 establishes minimum design requirements so that the structural components of buildings are proportioned to resist the loads that are likely to be encountered. In addition, this chapter assigns buildings and structures to risk categories that are indicative of their intended use. The loads specified herein along with the required load combinations have been established through research and service performance of buildings and structures. The application of these loads and adherence to the serviceability criteria enhance the protection of life and property.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."

For the purpose of this section, the shear force and the axial tensile force need not be considered to act simultaneously. Exception: Where beams, girders, open web joist and joist girders support a concrete slab or concrete slab on metal deck that is attached to the beam or girder with not less than 3/8-inch-diameter (9.5 mm) headed shear studs, at a spacing of not more than 12 inches (305 mm) on center, averaged over the length of the member, or other attachment having equivalent shear strength, and the slab contains continuous distributed reinforcement in each of two orthogonal directions with an area not less than 0.0015 times the concrete area, the nominal axial tension strength of the end connection shall be permitted to be taken as half the required vertical shear strength for ASD or one-third of the required shear strength for LRFD, but not less than 10 kips (45 kN)."
