20,,Boilers and Water Heaters,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 20 is specific to boilers and water heaters. The provisions of this chapter apply to appliances generally without regard to the energy source. Gas-fired boilers and water heaters are also addressed in Chapter 24; therefore, Chapters 20 and 24 both apply to such appliances.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Plumbing/Mechanical Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle."
