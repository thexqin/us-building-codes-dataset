R802.4.2,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Framing Details,"Rafters shall be framed opposite from each other to a ridge board, shall not be offset more than 11/2 inches (38 mm) from each other and shall be connected with a collar tie or ridge strap in accordance with Section R802.4.6 or directly opposite from each other to a gusset plate in accordance with Table R602.3(1). Rafters shall be nailed to the top wall plates in accordance with Table R602.3(1) unless the roof assembly is required to comply with the uplift requirements of Section R802.11."
R802.4.3,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Hips and Valleys,Hip and valley rafters shall be not less than 2 inches (51 mm) nominal in thickness and not less in depth than the cut end of the rafter. Hip and valley rafters shall be supported at the ridge by a brace to a bearing partition or be designed to carry and distribute the specific load at that point.
R802.4.4,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Rafter Supports,"Where the roof pitch is less than 3:12 (25-percent slope), structural members that support rafters, such as ridges, hips and valleys, shall be designed as beams, and bearing shall be provided for rafters in accordance with Section R802.6."
R802.4.5,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Purlins,Installation of purlins to reduce the span of rafters is permitted as shown in Figure R802.4.5. Purlins shall be sized not less than the required size of the rafters that they support. Purlins shall be continuous and shall be supported by 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) braces installed to bearing walls at a slope not less than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal. The braces shall be spaced not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) on center and the unbraced length of braces shall not exceed 8 feet (2438 mm). For SI: 1 degree = 0.018 rad. HC = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top of rafter support walls. HR = Height of roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.

R802.4.6,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Collar Ties,"Where collar ties are used to connect opposing rafters, they shall be located in the upper third of the attic space and fastened in accordance with Table R602.3(1). Collar ties shall be not less than 1 inch by 4 inches (25 mm × 102 mm) nominal, spaced not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) on center. Ridge straps shall be permitted to replace collar ties. Ridge straps shall be not less than 11/4-inch (32 mm) × 20 gage and shall be nailed to the top edge of each rafter with not fewer than three 10d common (3"" × 0.148"") nails with the closest nail not closer than 23/8 inches (60.3 mm)from the end of the rafter."
R802.5,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Ceiling Joists,Ceiling joists shall be continuous across the structure or securely joined where they meet over interior partitions in accordance with Section R802.5.2.1. Ceiling joists shall be fastened to the top plate in accordance with Table R602.3(1).
R802.5.1,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Ceiling Joist Size,"Ceiling joists shall be sized based on the joist spans in Tables R802.5.1(1) and R802.5.1(2).

Alternatively, sufficient rigid board or sheet insulation shall be installed directly above the structural roof sheathing to maintain the monthly average temperature of the underside of the structural roof sheathing above 45°F (7°C). For calculation purposes, an interior air temperature of 68°F (20°C) is assumed and the exterior air temperature is assumed to be the monthly average outside air temperature of the three coldest months. In Climate Zones 1, 2 and 3, air-permeable insulation installed in unvented attics shall meet the following requirements: An approved vapor diffusion port shall be installed not more than 12 inches (305 mm) from the highest point of the roof, measured vertically from the highest point of the roof to the lower edge of the port. The port area shall be greater than or equal to 1:600 of the ceiling area. Where there are multiple ports in the attic, the sum of the port areas shall be greater than or equal to the area requirement. The vapor-permeable membrane in the vapor diffusion port shall have a vapor permeance rating of greater than or equal to 20 perms when tested in accordance with Procedure A of ASTM E96. The vapor diffusion port shall serve as an air barrier between the attic and the exterior of the building. The vapor diffusion port shall protect the attic against the entrance of rain and snow. Framing members and blocking shall not block the free flow of water vapor to the port. Not less than a 2-inch (51 mm) space shall be provided between any blocking and the roof sheathing. Air-permeable insulation shall be permitted within that space. The roof slope shall be greater than or equal to 3:12 (vertical/horizontal). Where only air-permeable insulation is used, it shall be installed directly below the structural roof sheathing, on top of the attic floor, or on top of the ceiling. Air-impermeable insulation, where used in conjunction with air-permeable insulation, shall be directly above or below the structural roof sheathing and is not required to meet the R-value in Table R806.5. Where directly below the structural roof sheathing, there shall be no space between the air-impermeable insulation and air-permeable insulation. Where air-permeable insulation is used and is installed directly below the roof structural sheathing, air shall be supplied at a flow rate greater than or equal to 50 CFM (23.6 L/s) per 1,000 square feet (93 m2) of ceiling. The air shall be supplied from ductwork providing supply air to the occupiable space when the conditioning system is operating. Alternatively, the air shall be supplied by a supply fan when the conditioning system is operating. Exceptions: Where both air-impermeable and air-permeable insulation are used, and the R-value in Table 806.5 is met, air supply to the attic is not required. Where only air-permeable insulation is used and is installed on top of the attic floor, or on top of the ceiling, air supply to the attic is not required. Where preformed insulation board is used as the air-impermeable insulation layer, it shall be sealed at the perimeter of each individual sheet interior surface to form a continuous layer.

Alternatively, sufficient continuous insulation shall be installed directly above the structural roof sheathing to maintain the monthly average temperature of the underside of the structural roof sheathing above 45°F (7°C). For calculation purposes, an interior air temperature of 68°F (20°C) is assumed and the exterior air temperature is assumed to be the monthly average outside air temperature of the three coldest months."
R807,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Attic Access,
R807.1,Chapter 8 Roof-Ceiling Construction,Attic Access,"Buildings with combustible ceiling or roof construction shall have an attic access opening to attic areas that have a vertical height of 30 inches (762 mm) or greater over an area of not less than 30 square feet (2.8 m2). The vertical height shall be measured from the top of the ceiling framing members to the underside of the roof framing members.The rough-framed opening shall be not less than 22 inches by 30 inches (559 mm by 762 mm) and shall be located in a hallway or other location with ready access. Where located in a wall, the opening shall be not less than 22 inches wide by 30 inches high (559 mm wide by 762 mm high). Where the access is located in a ceiling, minimum unobstructed headroom in the attic space shall be 30 inches (762 mm) at some point above the access measured vertically from the bottom of ceiling framing members. See Section M1305.1.2 for access requirements where mechanical equipment is located in attics."
