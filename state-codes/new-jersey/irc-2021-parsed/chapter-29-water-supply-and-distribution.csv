29,,Water Supply and Distribution,"User notes: About this chapter: Many plumbing fixtures require a supply of potable water. Other fixtures could be supplied with nonpotable water such as reclaimed water. Chapter 29 covers the requirements for water distribution piping systems to and within buildings. The regulations include the types of materials and the connection methods for such systems. This chapter regulates the assemblies, devices and methods that are used for the prevention of backflow of contaminated or polluted water into the potable water system. Also contained in this chapter are the design requirements for the installation of fire sprinkler systems, as such systems are connected to the potable water supply for the building. Storm water and some liquid waste from a building can be a source of nonpotable water that can used to reduce the volume of potable water supplied to the building. This chapter provides the requirements for storage, treatment and distribution of this resource. This chapter also regulates the piping systems for reclaimed water supplied by a wastewater treatment facility.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle."

Flow rate from Section P2904.4.2."
P2904.6.2.1,Chapter 29 Water Supply and Distribution,Available Pressure Equation,The pressure available to offset friction loss in the interior piping system (Pt) shall be determined in accordance with the Equation 29-1. (Equation 29-1) where: Pt = Pressure used in applying Tables P2904.6.2(4) through P2904.6.2(9). Psup = Pressure available from the water supply source. PLsvc = Pressure loss in the water service pipe. [Table P2904.6.2(1)] PLm = Pressure loss in the water meter. [Table P2904.6.2(2)] PLd = Pressure loss from devices other than the water meter. PLe = Pressure loss associated with changes in elevation. [Table P2904.6.2(3)] Psp = Maximum pressure required by a sprinkler.
P2904.6.2.2,Chapter 29 Water Supply and Distribution,Calculation Procedure,"Determination of the required size for water distribution piping shall be in accordance with the following procedure:Step 1—Determine PsupObtain the static supply pressure that will be available from the water main from the water purveyor, or for an individual source, the available supply pressure shall be in accordance with Section P2904.5.1.Step 2—Determine PLsvcUse Table P2904.6.2(1) to determine the pressure loss in the water service pipe based on the selected size of the water service.Step 3—Determine PLmUse Table P2904.6.2(2) to determine the pressure loss from the water meter, based on the selected water meter size.Step 4—Determine PLdDetermine the pressure loss from devices other than the water meter installed in the piping system supplying sprinklers, such as pressure-reducing valves, backflow preventers, water softeners or water filters. Device pressure losses shall be based on the device manufacturer's specifications. The flow rate used to determine pressure loss shall be the rate from Section P2904.4.2, except that 5 gpm (0.3 L/s) shall be added where the device is installed in a water service pipe that supplies more than one dwelling. As an alternative to deducting pressure loss for a device, an automatic bypass valve shall be installed to divert flow around the device when a sprinkler activates.Step 5—Determine PLeUse Table P2904.6.2(3) to determine the pressure loss associated with changes in elevation. The elevation used in applying the table shall be the difference between the elevation where the water source pressure was measured and the elevation of the highest sprinkler.Step 6—Determine PspDetermine the maximum pressure required by any individual sprinkler based on the flow rate from Section P2904.4.1. The required pressure is provided in the sprinkler manufacturer's published data for the specific sprinkler model based on the selected flow rate.Step 7—Calculate PtUsing Equation 29-1, calculate the pressure available to offset friction loss in water-distribution piping between the service valve and the sprinklers.Step 8—Determine the maximum allowable pipe lengthUse Tables P2904.6.2(4) through P2904.6.2(9) to select a material and size for water distribution piping. The piping material and size shall be acceptable if the developed length of pipe between the service valve and the most remote sprinkler does not exceed the maximum allowable length specified by the applicable table. Interpolation of Pt between the tabular values shall be permitted.The maximum allowable length of piping in Tables P2904.6.2(4) through P2904.6.2(9) incorporates an adjustment for pipe fittings. Additional consideration of friction losses associated with pipe fittings shall not be required."
P2904.7,Chapter 29 Water Supply and Distribution,Instructions and Signs,"An owner's manual for the fire sprinkler system shall be provided to the owner. A sign or valve tag shall be installed at the main shutoff valve to the water distribution system stating, ""Warning, the water system for this home supplies fire sprinklers that require certain flows and pressures to fight a fire. Devices that restrict the flow or decrease the pressure or automatically shut off the water to the fire sprinkler system, such as water softeners, filtration systems and automatic shutoff valves, shall not be added to this system without a review of the fire sprinkler system by a fire protection specialist. Do not remove this sign."""
P2904.8,Chapter 29 Water Supply and Distribution,Inspections,The water distribution system shall be inspected in accordance with Sections P2904.8.1 and P2904.8.2.
P2904.8.1,Chapter 29 Water Supply and Distribution,Preconcealment Inspection,"The following items shall be verified prior to the concealment of any sprinkler system piping:Sprinklers are installed in all areas as required by Section P2904.1.1.Where sprinkler water spray patterns are obstructed by construction features, luminaires or ceiling fans, additional sprinklers are installed as required by Section P2904.2.4.2.Sprinklers are the correct temperature rating and are installed at or beyond the required separation distances from heat sources as required by Sections P2904.2.1 and P2904.2.2.The pipe size equals or exceeds the size used in applying Tables P2904.6.2(4) through P2904.6.2(9) or, if the piping system was hydraulically calculated in accordance with Section P2904.6.1, the size used in the hydraulic calculation.The pipe length does not exceed the length permitted by Tables P2904.6.2(4) through P2904.6.2(9) or, if the piping system was hydraulically calculated in accordance with Section P2904.6.1, pipe lengths and fittings do not exceed those used in the hydraulic calculation.Nonmetallic piping that conveys water to sprinklers is listed for use with fire sprinklers.Piping is supported in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's and sprinkler manufacturer's installation instructions.The piping system is tested in accordance with the plumbing subcode (N.J.A.C. 5:23-3.15)."
