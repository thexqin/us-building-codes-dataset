ICC user notes: About this chapter: Chapter 34 contains broadly applicable requirements including provisions for the protection of the structural elements of a building, inspection of work, general installation and conductor identification. This chapter requires that all electrical system components be listed and labeled by an approved agency. The electrical provisions of this code are identical to the intent of the NEC provisions except that this code requires all electrical system components be listed and labeled. The code does not contain unique electrical requirements. A dwelling built to the code will have electrical systems identical to those required by the respective edition of the NEC. This code addresses only those electrical systems that are common to dwelling construction, and the NEC is referenced for any subject not addressed in the code."
