,,27,Chapter 27 Electrical,0,"User note: About this chapter: Electrical systems and components are integral to most structures; therefore it is necessary for the code to address their installation and protection. Structures depend on electricity for the operation of many life safety systems including fire alarm, smoke control and exhaust, fire suppression, fire command and communication systems. Since power supply to these systems is essential, Chapter 27 addresses where standby and emergency power must be provided."
