The wall thickness shall be equal to or greater than the thickness of the wall in the story above."
R608.6.2,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Wall Reinforcement for Wind,"Vertical wall reinforcement for resistance to out-of-plane wind forces shall be determined from Table R608.6(1), R608.6(2), R608.6(3) or R608.6(4). For the design of nonload-bearing walls, in Tables R608.6(1), R608.6(2) and R608.6(3) use the appropriate column labeled ""Top."" (see Sections R608.7.2.2.2 and R608.7.2.2.3). There shall be a vertical bar at corners of exterior walls. Unless more horizontal reinforcement is required by Section R608.7.2.2.1, the minimum horizontal reinforcement shall be four No. 4 bars [Grade 40 (280 MPa)] placed as follows: top bar within 12 inches (305 mm) of the top of the wall, bottom bar within 12 inches (305 mm) of the finish floor and one bar each at approximately one-third and two-thirds of the wall height."
R608.6.3,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Continuity of Wall Reinforcement Between Stories,"Vertical reinforcement required by this section shall be continuous between elements providing lateral support for the wall. Reinforcement in the wall of the story above shall be continuous with the reinforcement in the wall of the story below, or the foundation wall, if applicable. Lap splices, where required, shall comply with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1). Where the above-grade wall is supported by a monolithic slab-on-ground and footing, dowel bars with a size and spacing to match the vertical above-grade concrete wall reinforcement shall be embedded in the monolithic slab-on-ground and footing the distance required to develop the dowel bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2) and lap-spliced with the above-grade wall reinforcement in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1).Exception: Where reinforcement in the wall above cannot be made continuous with the reinforcement in the wall below, the bottom of the reinforcement in the wall above shall be terminated in accordance with one of the following:Extend below the top of the floor the distance required to develop the bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2).Lap-spliced in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1) with a dowel bar that extends into the wall below the distance required to develop the bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2).Where a construction joint in the wall is located below the level of the floor and less than the distance required to develop the bar in tension, the distance required to develop the bar in tension shall be measured from the top of the concrete below the joint. See Section R608.5.5."
R608.6.4,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Termination of Reinforcement,"Where indicated in Items 1 through 3, vertical wall reinforcement in the top-most story with concrete walls shall be terminated with a 90-degree (1.57 rad) standard hook complying with Section R608.5.4.5 and Figure R608.5.4(3). Vertical bars adjacent to door and window openings required by Section R608.8.1.2. Vertical bars at the ends of required solid wall segments (see Section R608.7.2.2.2). Vertical bars (other than end bars, see Item 2) used as shear reinforcement in required solid wall segments where the reduction factor for design strength, R3, used is based on the wall having horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement (see Section R608.7.2.2.3). The bar extension of the hook shall be oriented parallel to the horizontal wall reinforcement and be within 4 inches (102 mm) of the top of the wall. Horizontal reinforcement shall be continuous around the building corners by bending one of the bars and lap-splicing it with the bar in the other wall in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1). Exception: In lieu of bending horizontal reinforcement at corners, separate bent reinforcing bars shall be permitted provided that the bent bar is lap-spliced with the horizontal reinforcement in both walls in accordance with Section R608.5.4.3 and Figure R608.5.4(1). In required solid wall segments where the reduction factor for design strength, R3, is based on the wall having horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement in accordance with Section R608.7.2.2.1, horizontal wall reinforcement shall be terminated with a standard hook complying with Section R608.5.4.5 and Figure R608.5.4(3) or in a lap-splice, except at corners where the reinforcement shall be continuous as required."

For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the unreduced length, UR, of solid wall length required in each endwall. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building.Tabulated lengths in the ""minimum"" column are based on the requirement of Section 28.4.4 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum pressure of 16 psf multiplied by the wall area of the building and 8 psf multiplied by the roof area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the ""minimum"" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R608.7.1.1.For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R608.7(2). The reduced length shall be not less than the ""minimum"" value shown in the table.Tabulated lengths for ""one story or top story of two story"" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for ""first story of two story"" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in this table or Table R608.7 (1B) or (1C), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R608.7(3).Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7(4).The reduction factors, R1, R2 and R3, in Tables R608.7(2), R608.7(3), and R608.7(4), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid wall segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R608.7.1 and R608.7.2.1, respectively.For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.TABLE R608.7(1B)UNREDUCED LENGTH, UR, OF SOLID WALL REQUIRED IN EACH EXTERIOR ENDWALL FOR WIND PERPENDICULAR TO RIDGE FIRST STORY OF TWO STORYa, c, d, e, f, g SIDEWALLLENGTH (feet) ENDWALLLENGTH (feet) ROOFSLOPE UNREDUCED LENGTH, UR, OF SOLID WALL REQUIRED IN ENDWALLS FOR WIND PERPENDICULAR TO RIDGE(feet) Basic Wind Speed (mph) Exposure 115B 120B 130B 140B 150B 160B Minimumb 110C 119C 127C 136C 110D 117D 125D 15 15 &lt; 1:12 2.98 3.25 3.81 4.42 5.07 5.77 2.54 5:12 4.13 4.50 5.28 6.12 7.03 8.00 2.76 7:12 4.31 4.70 5.51 6.39 7.34 8.35 2.87 12:12 5.51 6.00 7.04 8.16 9.37 10.66 3.15 30 &lt; 1:12 2.98 3.25 3.81 4.42 5.07 5.77 2.59 5:12 4.13 4.50 5.28 6.12 7.03 8.00 3.05 7:12 5.09 5.55 6.51 7.55 8.67 9.86 3.26 12:12 7.48 8.15 9.56 11.09 12.73 14.49 3.83 45 &lt; 1:12 2.98 3.25 3.81 4.42 5.07 5.77 2.65 5:12 4.13 4.50 5.28 6.12 7.03 8.00 3.34 7:12 5.88 6.40 7.51 8.71 10.00 11.37 3.65 12:12 9.46 10.30 12.09 14.02 16.09 18.31 4.51 60 &lt; 1:12 2.98 3.25 3.81 4.42 5.07 5.77 2.71 5:12 4.13 4.50 5.28 6.12 7.03 8.00 3.63 7:12 6.66 7.25 8.51 9.87 11.32 12.89 4.04 12:12 11.43 12.45 14.61 16.94 19.45 22.13 5.19 30 15 &lt; 1:12 5.32 5.79 6.80 7.89 9.05 10.30 5.06 5:12 7.39 8.04 9.44 10.95 12.57 14.30 5.47 7:12 7.94 8.65 10.15 11.77 13.51 15.37 5.65 12:12 9.94 10.82 12.70 14.73 16.91 19.24 6.17 30 &lt; 1:12 5.32 5.79 6.80 7.89 9.05 10.30 5.16 5:12 7.39 8.04 9.44 10.95 12.57 14.30 5.98 7:12 9.25 10.07 11.82 13.71 15.74 17.91 6.35 12:12 13.25 14.43 16.93 19.64 22.54 25.65 7.38 45 &lt; 1:12 5.32 5.79 6.80 7.89 9.05 10.30 5.27 5:12 7.39 8.04 9.44 10.95 12.57 14.30 6.50 7:12 10.56 11.50 13.50 15.65 17.97 20.45 7.06 12:12 16.56 18.03 21.16 24.55 28.18 32.06 8.60 60 &lt; 1:12 5.32 5.79 6.80 7.89 9.05 10.30 5.38 5:12 7.39 8.04 9.44 10.95 12.57 14.30 7.01 7:12 11.87 12.93 15.17 17.60 20.20 22.98 7.76 12:12 19.87 21.64 25.40 29.45 33.81 38.47 9.81 60 15 &lt; 1:12 9.87 10.74 12.61 14.62 16.79 19.10 10.10 5:12 13.71 14.93 17.52 20.32 23.33 26.54 10.87 7:12 15.08 16.42 19.27 22.35 25.66 29.20 11.22 12:12 18.67 20.33 23.86 27.67 31.77 36.14 12.19 30 &lt; 1:12 9.87 10.74 12.61 14.62 16.79 19.10 10.30 5:12 13.71 14.93 17.52 20.32 23.33 26.54 11.85 7:12 17.44 18.99 22.29 25.85 29.67 33.76 12.54 12:12 24.62 26.81 31.46 36.49 41.89 47.66 14.48 45 &lt; 1:12 10.27 11.18 13.12 15.21 17.47 19.87 10.50 5:12 14.26 15.52 18.22 21.13 24.26 27.60 12.82 7:12 20.21 22.01 25.83 29.95 34.39 39.12 13.86 12:12 31.20 33.97 39.87 46.23 53.07 60.39 16.76 60 &lt; 1:12 10.64 11.59 13.60 15.77 18.11 20.60 10.70 5:12 14.77 16.09 18.88 21.90 25.14 28.60 13.79 7:12 23.05 25.09 29.45 34.15 39.21 44.61 15.18 12:12 37.97 41.34 48.52 56.27 64.60 73.49 19.05 For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 mile per hour = 0.447 m/s, 1 pound force per linear foot = 0.146 kN/m, 1 pound per square foot = 47.88 Pa.Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 28.4-1 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet, topographic factor, Kzt, equal to 1.0, and Risk Category II.

The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each sidewall. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the unreduced length, UR, of solid wall length required in each sidewall. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building.Tabulated lengths in the ""minimum"" column are based on the requirement of Section 28.4.4 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum pressure of 16 psf multiplied by the wall area of the building and 8 psf multiplied by the roof area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the ""minimum"" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R608.7.1.1.For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R608.7(2). The reduced length shall be not less than the ""minimum"" value shown in the table.Tabulated lengths for ""one story or top story of two story"" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for ""first story of two story"" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in this table or Table R608.7(1A) or (1B), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R608.7(3).Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7(4).The reduction factors, R1, R2 and R3, in Tables R608.7(2), R608.7(3), and R608.7(4), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid walls segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R608.7.1 and R608.7.2.1, respectively.For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.TABLE R608.7(2)REDUCTION FACTOR, R1, FOR BUILDINGS WITH MEAN ROOF HEIGHT LESS THAN 35 FEETa MEAN ROOF HEIGHTb, c(feet) REDUCTION FACTOR R1, FOR MEAN ROOF HEIGHT Exposure category B C D &lt; 15 0.96 0.84 0.87 20 0.96 0.89 0.91 25 0.96 0.93 0.94 30 0.96 0.97 0.98 35 1.00 1.00 1.00 For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 degree = 0.0175 rad.See Section R608.7.1.1 and Note c to Table R608.7(1A) for application of reduction factors in this table.

R608.7.1,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Length of Solid Wall,"Each exterior wall line in each story shall have a total length of solid wall required by Section R608.7.1.1. A solid wall is a section of flat, waffle-grid or screen-grid wall, extending the full story height without openings or penetrations, except those permitted by Section R608.7.2. Solid wall segments that contribute to the total length of solid wall shall comply with Section R608.7.2."
R608.7.1.1,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Length of Solid Wall for Wind,"Buildings shall have solid walls in each exterior endwall line (the side of a building that is parallel to the span of the roof or floor framing) and sidewall line (the side of a building that is perpendicular to the span of the roof or floor framing) to resist lateral in-plane wind forces. The site-appropriate basic wind speed and exposure category shall be used in Tables R608.7(1A) through (1C) to determine the unreduced total length, UR, of solid wall required in each exterior endwall line and sidewall line. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet (10 668 mm), the unreduced values determined from Tables R608.7(1A) though (1C) are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R1, from Table R608.7(2); however, reduced values shall be not less than the minimum values in Tables R608.7(1A) through (1C). Where the floor-to-ceiling height of a story is less than 10 feet (3048 mm), the unreduced values determined from Tables R608.7(1A) through (C), including minimum values, are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R2, from Table R608.7(3). To account for different design strengths than assumed in determining the values in Tables R608.7(1A) through (1C), the unreduced lengths determined from Tables R608.7(1A) through (1C), including minimum values, are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R3, from Table R608.7(4). The reductions permitted by Tables R608.7(2), R608.7(3) and R608.7(4) are cumulative. The total length of solid wall segments, TL, in a wall line that comply with the minimum length requirements of Section R608.7.2.1 [see Figure R608.7(1)] shall be equal to or greater than the product of the unreduced length of solid wall from Tables R608.7(1A) through (1C), UR and the applicable reduction factors, if any, from Tables R608.7(2), R608.7(3) and R608.7(4) as indicated by Equation R6-1.

The total length of solid wall in a wall line, TL, shall be not less than that provided by two solid wall segments complying with the minimum length requirements of Section R608.7.2.1. To facilitate determining the required wall thickness, wall type, number and grade of vertical bars at each end of each solid wall segment, and whether shear reinforcement is required, use of Equation R6-2 is permitted. (Equation R6-2) After determining the maximum permitted value of the reduction factor for design strength, R3, in accordance with Equation R6-2, select a wall type from Table R608.7(4) with R3 less than or equal to the value calculated."

Solid wall segments shall extend the full story-height without openings, other than openings for the utilities and other building services passing through the wall. In flat walls and waffle-grid walls, such openings shall have an area of less than 30 square inches (19 355 mm2) without any dimension exceeding 61/4 inches (159 mm), and shall not be located within 6 inches (152 mm) of the side edges of the solid wall segment. In screen-grid walls, such openings shall be located in the portion of the solid wall segment between horizontal and vertical cores of concrete and opening size and location are not restricted provided there is not any concrete removed."

In addition, not more than two solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length and less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in length shall be included in the required total length of solid wall. The maximum clear opening width shall be 18 feet (5486 mm). See Figure R608.7(1)."
R608.7.2.2.1,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Horizontal Shear Reinforcement,"Where reduction factors for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7(4) based on horizontal and vertical shear reinforcement being provided are used, solid wall segments shall have horizontal reinforcement consisting of minimum No. 4 bars. Horizontal shear reinforcement shall be the same grade of steel required for the vertical reinforcement at the ends of solid wall segments by Section R608.7.2.2.2.The spacing of horizontal reinforcement shall not exceed the smaller of one-half the length of the solid wall segment, minus 2 inches (51 mm), and 18 inches (457 mm). Horizontal shear reinforcement shall terminate in accordance with Section R608.6.4."
R608.7.2.2.2,Chapter 6 Wall Construction,Vertical Reinforcement,"Vertical reinforcement applicable to the reduction factor(s) for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7(4) that is used, shall be located at each end of each solid wall segment in accordance with the applicable detail in Figure R608.7(2). The No. 4 vertical bar required on each side of an opening by Section R608.8.1.2 is permitted to be used as reinforcement at the ends of solid wall segments where installed in accordance with the applicable detail in Figure R608.7(2). There shall be not less than two No. 4 bars at each end of solid wall segments located as required by the applicable detail in Figure R608.7(2). One of the bars at each end of solid wall segments shall be deemed to meet the requirements for vertical wall reinforcement required by Section R608.6.The vertical wall reinforcement at each end of each solid wall segment shall be developed below the bottom of the adjacent wall opening [see Figure R608.7(3)] by one of the following methods:Where the wall height below the bottom of the adjacent opening is equal to or greater than 22 inches (559 mm) for No. 4 or 28 inches (711 mm) for No. 5 vertical wall reinforcement, reinforcement around openings in accordance with Section R608.8.1 shall be sufficient.Where the wall height below the bottom of the adjacent opening is less than required by Item 1 above, the vertical wall reinforcement adjacent to the opening shall extend into the footing far enough to develop the bar in tension in accordance with Section R608.5.4.4 and Figure R608.5.4(2), or shall be lap-spliced with a dowel that is embedded in the footing far enough to develop the dowel-bar in tension."
