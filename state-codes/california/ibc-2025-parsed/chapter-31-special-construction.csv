3109.2,"Section 3109 Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs",California Swimming Pool Safety Act (Statewide),"NOTE: These regulations are subject to local government modification. You should verify the applicable local government requirements at the time of application for a building permit. The following text in this section contains the statutory language in the Swimming Pool Safety Act (HS Code, §§ 115920 — 115929) that is required to be duplicated and published in California Code of Regulations, Title 24. As such, the section numbers reflect those within the Health and Safety Code. 115920. This act shall be known and may be cited as the Swimming Pool Safety Act. (Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 925, Sec. 3.5. Effective January 1, 1997.) 115921. As used in this article the following terms have the following meanings: ""Swimming pool"" or ""pool"" means any structure intended for swimming or recreational bathing that contains water over 18 inches deep. ""Swimming pool"" includes in-ground and aboveground structures and includes, but is not limited to, hot tubs, spas, portable spas and nonportable wading pools. ""Public swimming pool"" means a swimming pool operated for the use of the general public with or without charge, or for the use of the members and guests of a private club. Public swimming pool does not include a swimming pool located on the grounds of a private single-family home. ""Enclosure"" means a fence, wall or other barrier that isolates a swimming pool from access to the home. ""ANSI/APSP performance standard"" means a standard that is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and published by the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals (APSP). ""Suction outlet"" means a fitting or fixture typically located at the bottom or on the sides of a swimming pool that conducts water to a recirculating pump. [Amended by Stats. 2024, Ch 769 (SB 552) Effective January 1, 2025.] 115922. Except as provided in Section 115925, subject to subdivision (b), and consistent with Section 1596.814, when a building permit is issued for the construction of a new swimming pool or spa or the remodeling of an existing swimming pool or spa at a private single-family home, the respective swimming pool or spa shall be equipped with at least two of the following seven drowning prevention safety features: An enclosure that meets the requirements of Section 115923 and isolates the swimming pool or spa from the private single-family home. Removable mesh fencing that meets the ASTM International F2286 standard in conjunction with a gate that is self-closing and self-latching and can accommodate a key lockable device. A manually operated or power-operated safety pool cover that is accompanied by a label verifying that the cover meets the specifications of the ASTM International F1346-23 standard. Exit alarms on the private single-family home's doors and windows that provide direct access to the swimming pool or spa without any intervening enclosure. Whenever any door or window is opened or left ajar, exit alarms shall make either an audible, continuous alarm sound or a repeating verbal warning, such as a notification that ""the door to the pool is open."" An exit alarm may be battery operated or connected to the electrical wiring of the building. A self-closing, self-latching device with a release mechanism placed no lower than 54 inches above the floor on the private single-family home's doors providing direct access to the swimming pool or spa.

The alarm shall meet and be independently certified to the ASTM International F2208 standard that includes surface motion, pressure, sonar, laser and infrared type alarms. A swimming protection alarm feature designed for individual use, including an alarm attached to a child that sounds when the child exceeds a certain distance or becomes submerged in water, is not a qualifying drowning prevention safety feature. Other means of protection, if the degree of protection afforded is equal to or greater than that afforded by any of the features set forth above and has been independently verified by an approved testing laboratory as meeting standards for those features established by ASTM International, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, or another nationally recognized standards development organization, and the feature is accompanied by a label verifying that the protection meets those standards. The requirements of subdivision (a) are not satisfied by any of the following: An exit alarm and a self-closing, self-latching device on the same door.

The circulation system shall have the capacity to provide a complete turnover of pool water, as specified in Section 3124B of Chapter 31B of the California Building Standards Code (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations). Suction outlets shall be covered with anti-entrapment grates, as specified in the ANSI/APSP-16 performance standard or successor standard designated by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, that cannot be removed except with the use of tools. Slots or openings in the grates or similar protective devices shall be of a shape, area and arrangement that would prevent physical entrapment and would not pose any suction hazard to bathers. Any backup safety system that an owner of a new swimming pool or spa may choose to install in addition to the requirements set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b) shall meet the standards as published in the document, ""Guidelines for Entrapment Hazards: Making Pools and Spas Safer,"" Publication Number 363, March 2005, United States Consumer Product Safety Commission.

3114.8.5.3,Section 3114 Intermodal Shipping Containers,Allowable Shear,"The allowable shear for the profiled steel panel side walls (longitudinal) and end walls (transverse) for wind design and seismic design using the coefficients of Section 3114.8.5.2 shall be in accordance with Table 3114.8.5.3, provided that all of the following conditions are met: The total linear length of all openings in any individual side wall or end wall shall be limited to not more than 50 percent of the length of that side wall or end wall, as shown in Figure 3114.8.5.3(1). Any full-height wall length, or portion thereof, less than 4 feet (305 mm) shall not be considered as a portion of the lateral force-resisting system, as shown in Figure 3114.8.5.3(2). All side walls or end walls used as part of the lateral force-resisting system shall have an existing or new boundary element on all sides to form a continuous load path, or paths, with adequate strength and stiffness to transfer all forces from the point of application to the final point of resistance, as shown in Figure 3114.8.5.3(3).
