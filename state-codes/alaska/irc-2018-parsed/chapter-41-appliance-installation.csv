E4101.3,Chapter 41 Appliance Installation,Flexible Cords,"Cord-and-plug-connected appliances shall use cords suitable for the environment and physical conditions likely to be encountered. Flexible cords shall be used only where the appliance is listed to be connected with a flexible cord. The cord shall be identified as suitable in the installation instructions of the appliance manufacturer. Receptacles for cord-and-plug-connected appliances shall be accessible and shall be located to avoid physical damage to the flexible cord. Except for a listed appliance marked to indicate that it is protected by a system of double-insulation, the flexible cord supplying an appliance shall terminate in a grounding-type attachment plug. The cord lengths specified for built-in dishwashers and trash compactors shall be measured from the face of the attachment plug to the plane of the rear of the appliance. A receptacle for a cord-and-plug-connected range hood shall be supplied by an individual branch circuit. A receptacle for a built-in dishwasher shall be located in a space adjacent to the space occupied by the dishwasher. Specific appliances have additional requirements as specified in Table E4101.3 (see Section E3909).

Where the overcurrent protection rating is not marked and the appliance is rated at over 13.3 amperes, the overcurrent protection shall not exceed 150 percent of the appliance rated current. Where 150 percent of the appliance rating does not correspond to a standard overcurrent device ampere rating, the next higher standard rating shall be permitted. Where the overcurrent protection rating is not marked and the appliance is rated at 13.3 amperes or less, the overcurrent protection shall not exceed 20 amperes. [422.11(E)]"
E4101.5,Chapter 41 Appliance Installation,Disconnecting Means,"Each appliance shall be provided with a means to disconnect all ungrounded supply conductors. For fixed electric space-heating equipment, means shall be provided to disconnect the heater and any motor controller(s) and supplementary overcurrent-protective devices. Switches and circuit breakers used as a disconnecting means shall be of the indicating type. Disconnecting means shall be as set forth in Table E4101.5. (422.30, 422.35, and 424.19) TABLE E4101.5 DISCONNECTING MEANS [422.31(A), (B), and (C); 422.34; 422.35; 424.19; 424.20; and 440.14] DESCRIPTION ALLOWED DISCONNECTING MEANS Permanently connected appliance rated at not over 300 volt-amperes or 1/8 horsepower. Branch-circuit overcurrent device where the switch or circuit breaker is within sight of the appliance or is capable of being locked in the open position in compliance with Section E4101.8. Permanently connected appliances rated in excess of 300 volt-amperes. Branch circuit switch or circuit breaker located within sight of the appliance or such devices in any location that are capable of being locked in the open position in compliance with Section E4101.8. Motor-operated appliances rated over 1/8 horsepower. For permanently connected motor-operated appliances with motors rated over 1/8 horsepower, the disconnecting means shall be within sight from the appliance or it shall be capable of being locked in the open position in compliance with Section E4101.8. The disconnecting means shall be one of the following types: a listed motor-circuit switch rated in horsepower, a listed molded case circuit breaker, a listed molded case switch, a listed manual motor controller additionally marked ""Suitable as Motor Disconnect"" where installed between the final motor branch-circuit short-circuit protective device and the motor. For stationary motors rated at 2 hp or less and 300 volts or less, the disconnecting means shall be permitted to be one of the following devices: A general-use switch having an ampere rating not less than twice the full-load current rating of the motor. On AC circuits, a general-use snap switch suitable only for use on AC, not general-use AC—DC snap switches, where the motor full-load current rating is not more than 80 percent of the ampere rating of the switch. A listed manual motor controller having a horsepower rating not less than the rating of the motor and marked ""Suitable as Motor Disconnect"". The disconnecting means shall have an ampere rating not less than 115 percent of the full-load current rating of the motor except that a listed unfused motor-circuit switch having a horsepower rating not less than the motor horsepower shall be permitted to have an ampere rating less than 115 percent of the full-load current rating of the motor. Exception: Where an appliance of more than 1/8 hp is provided with a unit switch with a marked-off position that is a part of the appliance and disconnects all ungrounded conductors, such unit switch shall be permitted as the disconnecting means and the switch or circuit breaker serving as the other disconnecting means shall be permitted to be not within sight from the appliance.
