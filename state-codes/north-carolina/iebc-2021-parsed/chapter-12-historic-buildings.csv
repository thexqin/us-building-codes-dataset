,,12,Chapter 12 Historic Buildings,0,"User note:About this chapter: Chapter 12 provides some exceptions from code requirements when the building in question has historic value. The most important criterion for application of this chapter is that the building must be essentially accredited as being of historic significance by a state or local authority after careful review of the historical value of the building. Most, if not all, states have such authorities, as do many local jurisdictions. The agencies with such authority can be located at the state or local government level or through the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Other considerations include the structural condition of the building (i.e., is the building structurally sound), its proposed use, its impact on life safety and how the intent of the code, if not the letter, will be achieved."

12.1201,Section 1201 General,1201.2,[BS]  1201.2 Report,2,"A historic building undergoing repair, alteration, or change of occupancy shall be investigated and evaluated. If it is intended that the building meet the requirements of this chapter, a written report shall be prepared and filed with the code official by a registered design professional when such a report is necessary in the opinion of the code official. Such report shall be in accordance with Chapter 1 and shall identify each required safety feature that is in compliance with this chapter and where compliance with other chapters of these provisions would be damaging to the contributing historic features. For buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, a structural evaluation describing, at a minimum, the vertical and horizontal elements of the lateral force-resisting system and any strengths or weaknesses therein shall be prepared. Additionally, the report shall describe each feature that is not in compliance with these provisions and shall demonstrate how the intent of these provisions is complied with in providing an equivalent level of safety."

Adequate means of egress in such buildings, which may include a means of maintaining doors in an open position to permit egress, a limit on building occupancy to an occupant load permitted by the means of egress capacity, a limit on occupancy of certain areas or floors, or supervision by a person knowledgeable in the emergency exiting procedures, shall be provided."
