501,Chapter 5 Prescriptive Compliance Method,General,
501.1,Section 501 General,Scope,"The provisions of this chapter shall control the alteration, addition and change of occupancy of existing buildings and structures, including historic buildings and structures as referenced in Section 301.3.1."
501.1.1,Section 501 General,Compliance With Other Methods,"Alterations, additions and changes of occupancy to existing buildings and structures shall comply with the provisions of this chapter or with one of the methods provided in Section 301.3."
501.2,Section 501 General,Fire-Resistance Ratings,"Where approved by the code official, in buildings where an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 of the International Building Code has been added, and the building is now sprinklered throughout, the required fire-resistance ratings of building elements and materials shall be permitted to meet the requirements of the current building code. Fire assemblies that serve multiple purposes in a building shall comply with all the requirements that are applicable for each of the individual fire assemblies. The building is required to meet the other applicable requirements of the International Building Code. Plans, investigation and evaluation reports, and other data shall be submitted indicating which building elements and materials the applicant is requesting the code official to review and approve for determination of applying the current building code fire-resistance ratings. All special construction features, including fire-resistance-rated assemblies and smoke-resistive assemblies, conditions of occupancy, means of egress conditions, fire code deficiencies, approved modifications or approved alternative materials, design and methods of construction, and equipment applying to the building that impact required fire-resistance ratings shall be identified in the evaluation reports submitted. Where fire-resistance rated assemblies serve more than one function, each function shall be identified and individually evaluated under the requirements of the current code."
