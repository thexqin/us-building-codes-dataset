,,1,Chapter 1 Scope and Administration,0,"User note: About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Administration (Sections 101—102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103—117). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes®as applicable. This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document, and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the registered design professional, contractor and property owner."

Failure to grant the modification would result in exceptional hardship as demonstrated by the applicant and approved by the code official. See Appendix G, Flood Resistant Construction, of the International Building Code. The granting of the modification will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or ordinances as demonstrated by the applicant and approved by the code official. See Appendix G, Flood Resistant Construction, of the International Building Code. The modification is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard. A written notice will be provided by the code official to the applicant specifying, if applicable, the difference between the design flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation and that construction below the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Test methods shall be as specified in this code or by other recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test methods, the code official shall approve the testing procedures.
