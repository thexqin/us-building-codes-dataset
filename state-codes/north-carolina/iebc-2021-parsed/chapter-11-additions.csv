11,,Additions,"User note:About this chapter: Chapter 11 provides the requirements for additions, which correlate to the code requirements for new construction. There are, however, some exceptions that are specifically stated within this chapter. An ""Addition"" is defined in Chapter 2 as ""an extension or increase in the floor area, number of stories or height of a building or structure."" Chapter 11 contains the minimum requirements for an addition that is not separated from the existing building by a fire wall."
1101,Chapter 11 Additions,General,
1101.1,Section 1101 General,Scope,"An addition to a building or structure shall comply with the International Codes as adopted for new construction without requiring the existing building or structure to comply with any requirements of those codes or of these provisions, except as required by this chapter. Where an addition impacts the existing building or structure, that portion shall comply with this code."
1101.2,Section 1101 General,Creation or Extension of Nonconformity,"An addition shall not create or extend any nonconformity in the existing building to which the addition is being made with regard to accessibility, structural strength, fire safety, means of egress, or the capacity of mechanical, plumbing, or electrical systems."
1101.3,Section 1101 General,Other Work,Any repair or alteration work within an existing building to which an addition is being made shall comply with the applicable requirements for the work as classified in Chapter 6.
1102,Chapter 11 Additions,Heights and Areas,
1102.1,Section 1102 Heights and Areas,Height Limitations,No addition shall increase the height of an existing building beyond that permitted under the applicable provisions of Chapter 5 of the International Building Code for new buildings.
1102.2,Section 1102 Heights and Areas,Area Limitations,No addition shall increase the area of an existing building beyond that permitted under the applicable provisions of Chapter 5 of the International Building Code for new buildings unless fire separation as required by the International Building Code is provided. Exception: In-filling of floor openings and nonoccupiable appendages such as elevator and exit stairway shafts shall be permitted beyond that permitted by the International Building Code.
1102.3,Section 1102 Heights and Areas,Fire Protection Systems,Existing fire areas increased by the addition shall comply with Chapter 9 of the International Building Code. Exception: This requirement shall not apply to increases to the allowable fire area of 5 percent or less.
1103,Chapter 11 Additions,Structural,
1103.1,Section 1103 Structural,Additional Gravity Loads,"Any existing gravity load-carrying structural element for which an addition and its related alterations cause an increase in design dead, live or snow load, including snow drift effects, of more than 10 percent shall be replaced or altered as needed to carry the gravity loads required by the International Building Code for new structures. Any existing gravity load-carrying structural element whose gravity load-carrying capacity is decreased as part of the addition and its related alterations shall be considered to be an altered element subject to the requirements of Section 805.2. Any existing element that will form part of the lateral load path for any part of the addition shall be considered to be an existing lateral load-carrying structural element subject to the requirements of Section 1103.3. Exception: Buildings of Group R occupancy with not more than five dwelling units or sleeping units used solely for residential purposes where the existing building and the addition comply with the conventional lightframe construction methods of the International Building Code or the provisions of the International Residential Code."
1103.2,Section 1103 Structural,Lateral Force-Resisting System,"Where the addition is structurally independent of the existing structure, existing lateral load-carrying structural elements shall be permitted to remain unaltered. Where the addition is not structurally independent of the existing structure, the existing structure and its addition acting together as a single structure shall meet the requirements of Sections 1609 and 1613 of the International Building Code using full seismic forces. Exceptions: Buildings of Group R occupancy with not more than five dwelling or sleeping units used solely for residential purposes where the existing building and the addition comply with the conventional light-frame construction methods of the International Building Code or the provisions of the International Residential Code. Any existing lateral load-carrying structural element whose demand-capacity ratio with the addition considered is not more than 10 percent greater than its demand-capacity ratio with the addition ignored shall be permitted to remain unaltered. For purposes of calculating demand-capacity ratios, the demand shall consider applicable load combinations with design lateral loads or forces in accordance with Sections 1609 and 1613 of the International Building Code. For purposes of this exception, comparisons of demand-capacity ratios and calculation of design lateral loads, forces and capacities shall account for the cumulative effects of additions and alterations since original construction."
1103.3,Section 1103 Structural,Flood Hazard Areas,"Additions and foundations in flood hazard areas shall comply with the following requirements: For horizontal additions that are structurally interconnected to jjthe existing building: If the addition and all other proposed work, when combined, constitute substantial improvement, the existing building and the addition shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable. If the addition constitutes substantial improvement, the existing building and the addition shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable. For horizontal additions that are not structurally interconnected to the existing building: The addition shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable. If the addition and all other proposed work, when combined, constitute substantial improvement, the existing building and the addition shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable. For vertical additions and all other proposed work that, when combined, constitute substantial improvement, the existing building shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable. For a raised or extended foundation, if the foundation work and all other proposed work, when combined, constitute substantial improvement, the existing building shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable. For a new foundation or replacement foundation, the foundation shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code or Section R322 of the International Residential Code, as applicable."
1104,Chapter 11 Additions,Energy Conservation,
1104.1,Section 1104 Energy Conservation,Minimum Requirements,Additions to existing buildings shall conform to the energy requirements of the International Energy Conservation Code or International Residential Code as they relate to new construction. Refer to Section 101.12 for a list of exemptions.
