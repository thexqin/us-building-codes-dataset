3,,Building Planning,"User note:About this chapter: Chapter 3 contains a wide array of building planning requirements that are critical to designing a safe and usable building. This includes, but is not limited to, requirements related to general structural design, fire-resistant construction, light, ventilation, sanitation, plumbing fixture clearances, minimum room area and ceiling height, safety glazing, means of egress, automatic fire sprinkler systems, smoke and carbon monoxide alarm systems, accessibility, solar energy systems, swimming pools, spas and hot tubs."
R301,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Design Criteria,
R301.1,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Application,"Buildings and structures, and parts thereof, shall be constructed to safely support all loads, including dead loads, live loads, roof loads, flood loads, snow loads, wind loads and seismic loads as prescribed by this code. The construction of buildings and structures in accordance with the provisions of this code shall result in a system that provides a complete load path that meets the requirements for the transfer of loads from their point of origin through the load-resisting elements to the foundation. Buildings and structures constructed as prescribed by this code are deemed to comply with the requirements of this section."
R301.1.1,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Alternative Provisions,"As an alternative to the requirements in Section R301.1, the following standards are permitted subject to the limitations of this code and the limitations therein. Where engineered design is used in conjunction with these standards, the design shall comply with the International Building Code.AWC Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM).AISI Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Prescriptive Method for One- and Two-Family Dwellings (AISI S230).ICC Standard on the Design and Construction of Log Structures (ICC 400). Sunrooms complying with AAMA/NPEA/NSA 2100."
R301.1.2,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Construction Systems,"The requirements of this code are based on platform and balloon-frame construction for light-frame buildings. The requirements for concrete and masonry buildings are based on a balloon framing system. Other framing systems must have equivalent detailing to ensure force transfer, continuity and compatible deformations."
R301.1.3,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Engineered Design,"Where a building of otherwise conventional construction contains structural elements exceeding the limits of Section R301 or otherwise not conforming to this code, these elements shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice. The extent of such design need only demonstrate compliance of nonconventional elements with other applicable provisions and shall be compatible with the performance of the conventional framed system. Engineered design in accordance with the International Building Code is permitted for buildings and structures, and parts thereof, included in the scope of this code."
R301.1.4,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Intermodal Shipping Containers,Intermodal shipping containers that are repurposed for use as buildings or structures shall be designed in accordance with the structural provisions in Section 3115 of the International Building Code.
R301.2,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Climatic and Geographic Design Criteria,"Buildings shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of this code as limited by the provisions of this section. Additional criteria shall be established by the local jurisdiction and set forth in Table R301.2.

Alaska and Hawaii are classified as severe and negligible, respectively. Lines defining areas are approximate only. Local conditions may be more or less severe than indicated by region classification. A severe classification is where weather conditions result in significant snowfall combined with extended periods during which there is little or no natural thawing, causing deicing salts to be used extensively.

R301.2.1,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Wind Design Criteria,"Buildings and portions thereof shall be constructed in accordance with the wind provisions of this code using the ultimate design wind speed in Table R301.2 as determined from Tables R301.2(4) and R301.2(5). Where different construction methods and structural materials are used for various portions of a building, the applicable requirements of this section for each portion shall apply. Where not otherwise specified, the wind loads listed in Tables R301.2(2) and R301.2(6) adjusted for height and exposure using Table R301.2.1(2) shall be used to determine design load performance requirements for wall coverings, curtain walls, roof coverings, exterior windows, skylights, garage doors and exterior doors. Asphalt shingles shall be designed for wind speeds in accordance with Section R905.2.4. Metal roof shingles shall be designed for wind speeds in accordance with Section R905.4.4. A continuous load path shall be provided to transmit the applicable uplift forces in Section R802.11.1 from the roof assembly to the foundation. Where ultimate design wind speeds in Figure R301.2(2) are less than the lowest wind speed indicated in the prescriptive provisions of this code, the lowest wind speed indicated in the prescriptive provisions of this code shall be used. Exception: Openings for exterior balconies, decks, or porches under roofs enclosed with screen or removable vinyl or acrylic wind break panels shall be exempt from the loads listed in Table R301.2(2) and the height and exposure factors listed in Table R301.2(3). Vinyl and acrylic glazed panels shall be removable. Removable panels shall be identified as removable by a decal.

For a site located in the transition zone between categories, the category resulting in the largest wind forces shall apply. Account shall be taken of variations in ground surface roughness that arise from natural topography and vegetation as well as from constructed features. For a site where multiple detached one- and two-family dwellings, townhouses or other structures are to be constructed as part of a subdivision or master-planned community, or are otherwise designated as a developed area by the authority having jurisdiction, the exposure category for an individual structure shall be based on the site conditions that will exist at the time when all adjacent structures on the site have been constructed, provided that their construction is expected to begin within 1 year of the start of construction for the structure for which the exposure category is determined. For any given wind direction, the exposure in which a specific building or other structure is sited shall be assessed as being one of the following categories:Exposure B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger. Exposure B shall be assumed unless the site meets the definition of another type exposure.Exposure C. Open terrain with scattered obstructions, including surface undulations or other irregularities, having heights generally less than 30 feet (9144 mm) extending more than 1,500 feet (457 m) from the building site in any quadrant. This exposure shall apply to any building located within Exposure B type terrain where the building is directly adjacent to open areas of Exposure C type terrain in any quadrant for a distance of more than 600 feet (183 m). This category includes flat, open country and grasslands.Exposure D. Flat, unobstructed areas exposed to wind flowing over open water, smooth mud flats, salt flats and unbroken ice for a distance of not less than 5,000 feet (1524 m). This exposure shall apply only to those buildings and other structures exposed to the wind coming from over the unobstructed area.
