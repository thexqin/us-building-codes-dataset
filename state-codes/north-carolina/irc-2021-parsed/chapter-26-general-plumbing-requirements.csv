,,26,Chapter 26 General Plumbing Requirements,0,"User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 26 contains general requirements that could apply to Chapters 26 through 33. Placing such requirements in only one location eliminates code development coordination issues associated with the same requirement in multiple locations. This chapter covers liquid waste disposal requirements, special installation provisions for flood hazard areas and requirements for third-party certification of materials and products that are required to comply with a referenced standard. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. The text of this chapter is extracted from the 2024 edition of the North Carolina Plumbing Code and has been modified where necessary to conform to the scope of application of the North Carolina Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings."
