This pressure shall be held for not less than 15 minutes. The system shall then be tight at all points. Exception: Rough plumbing testing for one- and two-family dwellings shall be as specified above except the water level shall be a minimum of 3 feet (914 mm) above the highest drainage fitting. Under slab piping systems shall be tested with a minimum of 10 feet (3048 mm) of head. Drainage and vent air test. An air test shall be made by forcing air into the system until there is a uniform gauge pressure of 5 psi (34.5 kPa) or sufficient to balance a 10-inch (254 mm) column of mercury. This pressure shall be held for a test period of not less than 15 minutes. Any adjustments to the test pressure required because of changes in ambient temperatures or the seating of gaskets shall be made prior to the beginning of the test period. Vacuum test. The portion under test shall be evacuated of air by a vacuum-type pump to achieve a uniform gauge pressure of -5 pounds per square inch or a negative 10 inches of mercury column (-34 kPa).
