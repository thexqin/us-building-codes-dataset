,,31,Chapter 31 Vents,0,"User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 31 regulates connection locations, various venting system arrangements and the sizing of piping for vent systems. The proper operation of a gravity flow drainage system (Chapter 30) depends on maintaining an air path throughout the system to prevent waste and odor ""blow back"" into fixtures and siphoning of the trap seal in fixture traps (Chapter 32). Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle."
