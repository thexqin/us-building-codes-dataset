Single-appliance venting configurations with lateral lengths include two 90-degree (1.57 rad) elbows. For each additional elbow up to and including 45 degrees (0.79 rad), the maximum capacity listed in the venting tables shall be reduced by 5 percent. For each additional elbow greater than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) up to and including 90 degrees (1.57 rad), the maximum capacity listed in the venting tables shall be reduced by 10 percent. Where multiple offsets occur in a vent, the total lateral length of all offsets combined shall not exceed that specified in Tables G2428.2(1) and G2428.2(2)."
G2428.2.4,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.4) Zero Lateral,Zero (0) lateral (L) shall apply only to a straight vertical vent attached to a top outlet draft hood or flue collar.
G2428.2.5,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.5) High-Altitude Installations,"Sea-level input ratings shall be used when determining maximum capacity for high-altitude installation. Actual input, derated for altitude, shall be used for determining minimum capacity for high-altitude installation."
G2428.2.6,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.6) Multiple Input Rate Appliances,"For appliances with more than one input rate, the minimum vent capacity (FAN Min) determined from the tables shall be less than the lowest appliance input rating, and the maximum vent capacity (FAN Max/NAT Max) determined from the tables shall be greater than the highest appliance rating input."
G2428.2.7,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.7) Liner System Sizing and Connections,Listed corrugated metallic chimney liner systems in masonry chimneys shall be sized by using Table G2428.2(1) or G2428.2(2) for Type B vents with the maximum capacity reduced by 20 percent (0.80 × maximum capacity) and the minimum capacity as shown in Table G2428.2(1) or G2428.2(2). Corrugated metallic liner systems installed with bends or offsets shall have their maximum capacity further reduced in accordance with Section G2428.2.3. The 20-percent reduction for corrugated metallic chimney liner systems includes an allowance for one long-radius 90-degree (1.57 rad) turn at the bottom of the liner.Connections between chimney liners and listed double-wall connectors shall be made with listed adapters designed for such purpose.
G2428.2.8,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.8) Vent Area and Diameter,"Where the vertical vent has a larger diameter than the vent connector, the vertical vent diameter shall be used to determine the minimum vent capacity, and the connector diameter shall be used to determine the maximum vent capacity. The flow area of the vertical vent shall not exceed seven times the flow area of the listed appliance categorized vent area, flue collar area, or draft hood outlet area unless designed in accordance with approved engineering methods."
G2428.2.9,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.9) Chimney and Vent Locations,"Tables G2428.2(1) and G2428.2(2) shall be used only for chimneys and vents not exposed to the outdoors below the roof line. A Type B vent or listed chimney lining system passing through an unused masonry chimney flue shall not be considered to be exposed to the outdoors. Where vents extend outdoors above the roof more than 5 feet (1524 mm) higher than required by Figure G2427.6.4, and where vents terminate in accordance with Section G2427.6.4, Item 2, the outdoor portion of the vent shall be enclosed as required by this section for vents not considered to be exposed to the outdoors or such venting system shall be engineered. A Type B vent shall not be considered to be exposed to the outdoors where it passes through an unventilated enclosure or chase insulated to a value of not less than R-8."
G2428.2.10,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.10) Corrugated Vent Connector Size,"Corrugated vent connectors shall be not smaller than the listed appliance categorized vent diameter, flue collar diameter, or draft hood outlet diameter."
G2428.2.11,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.11) Vent Connector Size Limitation,"Vent connectors shall not be increased in size more than two sizes greater than the listed appliance categorized vent diameter, flue collar diameter or draft hood outlet diameter."
G2428.2.12,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.2.12) Component Commingling,"In a single run of vent or vent connector, different diameters and types of vent and connector components shall be permitted to be used, provided that all such sizes and types are permitted by the tables."

G2428.3.1,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.1) Vent Obstructions,"These venting tables shall not be used where obstructions, as described in Section G2427.15, are installed in the venting system. The installation of vents serving listed appliances with vent dampers shall be in accordance with the appliance manufacturer's instructions or in accordance with the following: The maximum capacity of the vent connector shall be determined using the NAT Max column. The maximum capacity of the vertical vent or chimney shall be determined using the FAN + NAT column where the second appliance is a fan-assisted appliance, or the NAT + NAT column where the second appliance is equipped with a draft hood. The minimum capacity shall be determined as if the appliance were a fan-assisted appliance. The minimum capacity of the vent connector shall be determined using the FAN Min column. The FAN + FAN column shall be used where the second appliance is a fan-assisted appliance, and the FAN + NAT column shall be used where the second appliance is equipped with a draft hood, to determine whether the vertical vent or chimney configuration is not permitted (NA). Where the vent configuration is NA, the vent configuration shall not be permitted and an alternative venting configuration shall be utilized."
G2428.3.2,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.2) Connector Length Limit,"The vent connector shall be routed to the vent utilizing the shortest possible route.

G2428.3.3,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.3) Connectors With Longer Lengths,"Connectors with longer horizontal lengths than those listed in Section G2428.3.2 are permitted under the following conditions:The maximum capacity (FAN Max or NAT Max) of the vent connector shall be reduced 10 percent for each additional multiple of the length allowed by Section G2428.3.2. For example, the maximum length listed in Table G2428.3.2 for a 4-inch (102 mm) connector is 6 feet (1829 mm). With a connector length greater than 6 feet (1829 mm) but not exceeding 12 feet (3658 mm), the maximum capacity must be reduced by 10 percent (0.90 × maximum vent connector capacity). With a connector length greater than 12 feet (3658 mm), but not exceeding 18 feet (5486 mm), the maximum capacity must be reduced by 20 percent (0.80 × maximum vent capacity).For a connector serving a fan-assisted appliance, the minimum capacity (FAN Min) of the connector shall be determined by referring to the corresponding single-appliance table. For Type B double-wall connectors, Table G2428.2(1) shall be used. For single-wall connectors, Table G2428.2(2) shall be used. The height (H) and lateral (L) shall be measured according to the procedures for a single-appliance vent, as if the other appliances were not present."
G2428.3.4,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.4) Vent Connector Manifold,"Where the vent connectors are combined prior to entering the vertical portion of the common vent to form a common vent manifold, the size of the common vent manifold and the common vent shall be determined by applying a 10-percent reduction (0.90 × maximum common vent capacity) to the common vent capacity part of the common vent tables. The length of the common vent connector manifold (Lm) shall not exceed 11/2 feet for each inch (18 mm per mm) of common vent connector manifold diameter (D)."
G2428.3.5,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.5) Common Vertical Vent Offset,"Where the common vertical vent is offset, the maximum capacity of the common vent shall be reduced in accordance with Section G2428.3.6. The horizontal length of the common vent offset (Lo) shall not exceed 11/2 feet for each inch (18 mm per mm) of common vent diameter (D). Where multiple offsets occur in a common vent, the total horizontal length of all offsets combined shall not exceed 11/2 feet for each inch (18 mm per mm) of the common vent diameter (D)."
G2428.3.6,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.6) Elbows in Vents,"For each elbow up to and including 45 degrees (0.79 rad) in the common vent, the maximum common vent capacity listed in the venting tables shall be reduced by 5 percent. For each elbow greater than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) up to and including 90 degrees (1.57 rad), the maximum common vent capacity listed in the venting tables shall be reduced by 10 percent."
