11,,Accessibility,"About this chapter: Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility of buildings and their associated sites and facilities for people with physical disabilities. The fundamental philosophy of the code on the subject of accessibility is that everything is required to be accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1). The code's scoping requirements then address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of exceptions to this general mandate. While the IBC contains scoping provisions for accessibility (for example, what, where and how many), ICC A117.1, Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, is the referenced standard for the technical provisions (in other words, how). Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the International Existing Building Code®. The International Residential Code® references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter may be applicable to housing covered under the International Residential Code. The provisions in the I-Codes are intended to meet or exceed the requirements in the federal accessibility requirement found in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act. There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a tangible benefit to people without disabilities. This type of requirement can be set forth in the code as generally applicable without necessarily identifying it specifically as an accessibility-related issue. Such a requirement would then be considered as having been ""mainstreamed."" For example, visible alarms are located in Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed in Chapter 10."

1101.1,Section 1101 General,Scope,The provisions of this chapter shall control the design and construction of facilities for accessibility for individuals with disabilities.

1102.1,Section 1102 Compliance,Design,"Buildings and facilities shall be designed and constructed to be accessible in accordance with this code and ICC A117.1, as detailed in this chapter."
new_1102.1.1,Section 1102 Compliance,Alternate Methods,"The application of Section 104.10 to this chapter shall be limited to the extent that alternate methods of construction, designs or technologies provide substantially equivalent or greater accessibility. Where approved by the building official, the provisions of the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 may be considered as an alternate method to the criteria outlined in ICC A117.1 as it relates to covered multifamily dwellings. ORS 455.020 is not part of this code but is reprinted here for the reader's convenience: 447.220 Purpose. It is the purpose of ORS 447.210 to 447.280 to make affected buildings, including but not limited to commercial facilities, public accommodations, private entities, private membership clubs and churches, in the state accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, as provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act, and to make covered multifamily dwellings in the state accessible to and usable by all persons with disabilities, as provided in the Fair Housing Act. In requiring that buildings and facilities be usable by persons with disabilities, it is not the intention of the Legislative Assembly to require that items of personal convenience such as rest rooms, telephones and drinking fountains be provided for members of the public who have disabilities if they are not otherwise provided for members of the public who do not have disabilities. However, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may provide greater protection to individuals with disabilities by adopting more stringent standards than prescribed by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
