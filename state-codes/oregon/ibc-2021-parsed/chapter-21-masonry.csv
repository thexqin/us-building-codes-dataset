2113.16.1,Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys,Minimum Area,Round chimney flues shall have a minimum net cross-sectional area of not less than 1/12 of the fireplace opening. Square chimney flues shall have a minimum net cross-sectional area of not less than 1/10 of the fireplace opening. Rectangular chimney flues with an aspect ratio less than 2 to 1 shall have a minimum net cross-sectional area of not less than 1/10 of the fireplace opening. Rectangular chimney flues with an aspect ratio of 2 to 1 or more shall have a minimum net cross-sectional area of not less than 1/8 of the fireplace opening.
2113.16.2,Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys,Determination of Minimum Area,The minimum net cross-sectional area of the flue shall be determined in accordance with Figure 2113.16. A flue size providing not less than the equivalent net cross-sectional area shall be used. Cross-sectional areas of clay flue linings are as provided in Tables 2113.16(1) and 2113.16(2) or as provided by the manufacturer or as measured in the field. The height of the chimney shall be measured from the firebox floor to the top of the chimney flue.
2113.17,Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys,Inlet,"Inlets to masonry chimneys shall enter from the side. Inlets shall have a thimble of fireclay, rigid refractory material or metal that will prevent the connector from pulling out of the inlet or from extending beyond the wall of the liner."
2113.18,Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys,Masonry Chimney Cleanout Openings,"Cleanout openings shall be provided within 6 inches (152 mm) of the base of each flue within every masonry chimney. The upper edge of the cleanout shall be located not less than 6 inches (152 mm) below the lowest chimney inlet opening. The height of the opening shall be not less than 6 inches (152 mm). The cleanout shall be provided with a noncombustible cover.Exception: Chimney flues serving masonry fireplaces, where cleaning is possible through the fireplace opening."
2113.19,Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys,Chimney Clearances,"Any portion of a masonry chimney located in the interior of the building or within the exterior wall of the building shall have a minimum airspace clearance to combustibles of 2 inches (51 mm). Chimneys located entirely outside the exterior walls of the building, including chimneys that pass through the soffit or cornice, shall have a minimum airspace clearance of 1 inch (25 mm). The airspace shall not be filled, except to provide fireblocking in accordance with Section 2113.20. Exceptions: Masonry chimneys equipped with a chimney lining system listed and labeled for use in chimneys in contact with combustibles in accordance with UL 1777, and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, are permitted to have combustible material in contact with their exterior surfaces. Where masonry chimneys are constructed as part of masonry or concrete walls, combustible materials shall not be in contact with the masonry or concrete wall less than 12 inches (305 mm) from the inside surface of the nearest flue lining. Exposed combustible trim and the edges of sheathing materials, such as wood siding, are permitted to abut the masonry chimney sidewalls, in accordance with Figure 2113.19, provided that such combustible trim or sheathing is not less than 12 inches (305 mm) from the inside surface of the nearest flue lining. Combustible material and trim shall not overlap the corners of the chimney by more than 1 inch (25 mm). FIGURE 2113.19 ILLUSTRATION OF EXCEPTION THREE CHIMNEY CLEARANCE PROVISION"
2113.20,Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys,Chimney Fireblocking,"All spaces between chimneys and floors and ceilings through which chimneys pass shall be fireblocked with noncombustible material securely fastened in place. The fireblocking of spaces between wood joists, beams or headers shall be self-supporting or be placed on strips of metal or metal lath laid across the spaces between combustible material and the chimney."
