Design live loads for other areas shall be permitted to use previously approved design live loads.Exception: Structural elements whose demand-capacity ratio considering the change of occupancy is not more than 5 percent greater than the demand-capacity ratio based on previously approved live loads need not comply with this section.
506.5.2,Section 506 Change of Occupancy,Snow and Wind Loads,"Where a change of occupancy results in a structure being assigned to a higher risk category, the structure shall satisfy the requirements of Sections 1608 and 1609 of the International Building Code for the new risk category.Exception: Where the area of the new occupancy is less than 10 percent of the building area, compliance with this section is not required. The cumulative effect of occupancy changes over time shall be considered."
506.5.3,Section 506 Change of Occupancy,Seismic Loads (Seismic Force-Resisting System),"Where a change of occupancy results in a building being assigned to a higher risk category, or where the change is from a Group S or Group U occupancy to any occupancy other than Group S or Group U, the lateral force-resisting system of the building shall comply with Section 304.3.1 for the new risk category. Where a change of occupancy results in a building being assigned to Risk Category IV and Seismic Design Category D or F, nonstructural components serving any portion of the building changed to Risk Category IV shall comply with the requirements of Section 1613 of the International Building Code or shall comply with ASCE 41 using an objective of Operational nonstructural performance with the BSE-1N earthquake hazard level.Exceptions: Where the area of the new occupancy is less than 10 percent of the building area, the occupancy is not changing from a Group S or Group U occupancy, and the new occupancy is not assigned to Risk Category IV, compliance with this section is not required. The cumulative effect of occupancy changes over time shall be considered.Where a change of use results in a building being reclassified from Risk Category I or II to Risk Category III and the seismic coefficient, SDS, is less than 0.33, compliance with this section is not required.Unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings assigned to Risk Category III and to Seismic Design Category A or B, shall be permitted to use Appendix Chapter A1 of this code.Where the change is from a Group S or Group U occupancy and there is no change of risk category, compliance with Section 304.3.2 shall be permitted."
506.5.4,Section 506 Change of Occupancy,Access to Risk Category IV,"Any structure that provides operational access to an adjacent structure assigned to Risk Category IV as the result of a change of occupancy shall itself comply with Sections 1608 and 1609 of the International Building Code and Section 304.3.1 of this code. Where operational access to the Risk Category IV structure is less than 10 feet (3048 mm) from either an interior lot line or from another structure, access protection from potential falling debris shall be provided."
506.6,Section 506 Change of Occupancy,Enhanced Classroom Acoustics,"In Group E occupancies, where the work area exceeds 50 percent of the building area, enhanced classroom acoustics shall be provided in all classrooms with a volume of 20,000 cubic feet (565 m3) or less. Enhanced classroom acoustics shall comply with the reverberation time in Section 808 of ICC A117.1."
507,Chapter 5 Prescriptive Compliance Method,Historic Buildings,
507.1,Section 507 Historic Buildings,Historic Buildings,"The provisions of this code that require improvements relative to a building's existing condition or, in the case of repairs, that require improvements relative to a building's predamage condition, shall not be mandatory for historic buildings unless specifically required by this section."
507.2,Section 507 Historic Buildings,Life Safety Hazards,The provisions of this code shall apply to historic buildings judged by the code official to constitute a distinct life safety hazard.
507.3,Section 507 Historic Buildings,Flood Hazard Areas,"Within flood hazard areas established in accordance with Section 1612.3 of the International Building Code, or Section R306 of the International Residential Code, as applicable, where the work proposed constitutes substantial improvement, the building shall be brought into compliance with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R306 of the International Residential Code, as applicable.Exception: Historic buildings meeting any of the following criteria need not be brought into compliance:Listed or preliminarily determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.Determined by the Secretary of the US Department of Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined to qualify as an historic district.Designated as historic under a state or local historic preservation program that is approved by the Department of Interior."
