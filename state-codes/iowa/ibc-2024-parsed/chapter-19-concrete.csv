,,19,Chapter 19 Concrete,0,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 19 provides minimum accepted practices for the design and construction of buildings and structural components using concrete—both plain and reinforced. Chapter 19 relies primarily on the reference to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318, Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete. Structural concrete must be designed and constructed to comply with this code and all listed standards. There are also specific provisions addressing slabs-on-ground and shotcrete.This chapter was extensively reorganized for the 2024 edition. For complete information, see the relocations table in the Preface information of this code.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."
