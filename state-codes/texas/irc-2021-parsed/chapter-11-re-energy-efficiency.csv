11,,[RE] Energy Efficiency,"User note:About this chapter: The purpose of Chapter 11 [RE] is to provide minimum design requirements that will promote efficient utilization of energy in buildings. The requirements are directed toward the design of building envelopes with adequate thermal resistance and low air leakage, and toward the design and selection of mechanical, water heating, electrical and illumination systems that promote effective use of depletable energy resources."
N1101,Chapter 11 [RE] Energy Efficiency,General,
N1101.1,Chapter 11 [RE] Energy Efficiency,Scope,"This chapter regulates the energy efficiency for the design and construction of buildings regulated by this code. Note: The text of Sections N1101.2 through N1113 parallels the text of the 2021 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code—Residential Provisions (IECC-R). The section numbers appearing in parenthesis after each section number are the section numbers of the corresponding text in the IECC-R. If a section does not have a section number in parenthesis after it, then there is no corresponding text in the IECC-R."
