,,28,Chapter 28 Water Heaters,0,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 28 contains regulations concerning the safety of water heating units and hot water storage tanks. Heated potable water is needed for plumbing fixtures that are associated with washing, bathing and kitchen activities. Heated water is commonly stored in pressurized storage tanks that must be protected against explosion by pressure and temperature relief valves specified in this chapter. This chapter also covers the access requirements to water heaters and hot water storage tanks to allow for the maintenance and replacement of that equipment.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle."
