,,35,Chapter 35 Electrical Definitions,0,"ICC user notes:About this chapter: The electrical trade, like other construction trades, has its vernacular. If people do not understand the language of the code text, they will have difficulty interpreting that text. Many words have a unique meaning in the context of a particular code and may be defined differently in a dictionary.Because much code text meaning depends on the definitions of the terms used in the text, Chapter 35 lists the definitions of terms that do not have everyday, common, universally accepted or dictionary-defined meanings. Chapter 35 is provided as the key to understanding the electrical text."
