,,36,Chapter 36 Services,0,"ICC user notes:About this chapter: Chapter 36 is the first of the logical order of chapters that mimics the normal sequence of dwelling construction. The first step in dwelling wiring is typically the sizing, design and installation of the service that is the source of power for the building. This chapter addresses the sizing of services, service conductor sizing and installation, system grounding and bonding, overcurrent protection, disconnecting means and the grounding electrode system.This chapter requires services to be properly sized to serve the load. This is intended to prevent overloading and to provide the utility expected by the occupants. This chapter is also intended to protect occupants and the building from fire and protect the occupants from electrical shock hazards associated with service conductors and equipment."
