Structural steel column, either wide flange or tubular shapes. 15/8-inch deep studs fabricated from 0.0179-inch minimum thickness galvanized steel with 15/16 or 17/16-inch legs. The length of the steel studs shall be 1/2 inch less than the height of the assembly. Type X gypsum board or gypsum panel products in accordance with ASTM C177, C1178, C1278, C1396 or C1658. The total thickness of gypsum board or gypsum panel products calculated as h in Section 722.5.1.2 shall be applied vertically to an individual column using one of the following methods: As a single layer with no horizontal joints. As multiple layers with no horizontal joints permitted in any layer. As multiple layers with horizontal joints staggered not less than 12 inches vertically between layers and not less than 8 feet vertically in any single layer. The total required thickness of gypsum board or gypsum panel products shall be determined on the basis of the specified fire-resistance rating and the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of the column. Galvanized 0.0149-inch minimum thickness steel corner beads with 11/2-inch legs attached to the gypsum board or gypsum panel products with 1-inch-long Type S screws spaced 12 inches on center. No. 18 SWG steel tie wires spaced 24 inches on center. Sheet metal angles with 2-inch legs fabricated from 0.0221-inch minimum thickness galvanized steel. Type S screws, 1 inch long, shall be used for attaching the first layer of gypsum board or gypsum panel product to the steel studs and the third layer to the sheet metal angles at 24 inches on center. Type S screws 13/4-inch long shall be used for attaching the second layer of gypsum board or gypsum panel product to the steel studs and the fourth layer to the sheet metal angles at 12 inches on center. Type S screws 21/4 inches long shall be used for attaching the third layer of gypsum board or gypsum panel product to the steel studs at 12 inches on center. For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per linear foot/inch = 0.059 kg/m/mm. FIGURE 722.5.1(4)FIRE RESISTANCE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL COLUMNS PROTECTED WITH VARIOUS THICKNESSES OF TYPE X GYPSUM WALLBOARD The W/D ratios for typical wide flange columns are listed in Table 722.5.1(1). For other column shapes, the W/D ratios shall be determined in accordance with Section 722.5.1.1.

When the thickness of concrete cover is not constant, h shall be taken as the average of h1 and h2. Joints shall be protected with a minimum 1 inch thickness of ceramic fiber blanket but in no case less than one-half the thickness of the column cover (see Section 722.2.1.3). FIGURE 722.5.1(7)CONCRETE OR CLAY MASONRY PROTECTED STRUCTURAL STEEL COLUMNS For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm. d = Depth of a wide flange column, outside diameter of pipe column, or outside dimension of structural tubing column (inches). tweb = Thickness of web of wide flange column (inches). w = Width of flange of wide flange column (inches).
