Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Sections 101—102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103—116). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable. Standards and codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section 102.4). This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with maintaining ""due process of law"" in enforcing the building performance criteria contained in the body of the code. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the Administrative Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle."

When a matter is included in a specialty code or referenced publication that is in conflict with Oregon Revised Statutes or Oregon Administrative Rules, the statute or rule applies and the code or standard provision does not.

Unless required by law, matters generally not authorized for inclusion in a specialty code or referenced standard include, but are not limited to: licensing or certification requirements, or other qualifications and standards for businesses or workers; structures or equipment maintenance requirements; matters covered by federal or state law; and matters that conflict with other specialty codes or publications adopted by the department. OAR 918-008-0000 to OAR 918-008-0070 provides the process for adopting and amending the state building code that is consistent across all program areas. The state building code is derived from the most appropriate version of base model codes, which are updated periodically. The Oregon specialty code amendment process begins approximately midway into a code cycle. An appropriate advisory board approves or forwards the adoption of the Oregon specialty code and amendments to the Department for adoption. Notwithstanding sections (3) through (6) of this rule, the division may adopt supplemental code amendments as authorized by OAR 918-008-0028.

National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Each local community participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) designates a local flood plain administrator who is responsible to make sure communities meet their insurance program obligations. Certain matters comprised within the NFIP program may conflict with or overlap with the state building code. Certain decisions such as sill plate height and other NFIP criteria fall under the authority and responsibility of the flood plain administrator. Once decisions under the NFIP program are made, then the appropriate requirements of this code for the construction of the building are applied. Local communities may choose to designate their local building official as the flood plain administrator or may designate other staff. When a building official functioning in the capacity of flood plain administrator exercises authority under the NFIP, such decisions are not part of this code nor subject to the building official duties and responsibilities as adopted by the State of Oregon, Building Codes Division.
