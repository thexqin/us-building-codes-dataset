12,,Historic Buildings,Wall|Roof|Slab|Door|Window,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Residential (R)|Mercantile (M),sd|dd|cd,special_construction,architect,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 12 provides some exceptions from code requirements when the building in question has historic value. The most important criterion for application of this chapter is that the building must be essentially accredited as being of historic significance by a state or local authority after careful review of the historical value of the building. Most, if not all, states have such authorities, as do many local jurisdictions. The agencies with such authority can be located at the state or local government level or through the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Other considerations include the structural condition of the building (i.e., is the building structurally sound), its proposed use, its impact on life safety and how the intent of the code, if not the letter, will be achieved."

Any unsafe conditions are corrected. The restored building or structure will be no more hazardous based on life safety, fire safety and sanitation than the existing building.
