R908.8.1.7,Chapter 9 Roof Assemblies,Priorities for Mandated Roof-to-Wall Retrofit Expenditures,,,,,,"Priority shall be given to connecting the exterior corners of roofs to walls where the spans of the roofing members are greatest. For houses with both hip and gable roof ends, the priority shall be to retrofit the gable end roof-to-wall connections unless the width of the hip end is more than 1.5 times greater than the width of the gable end. When considering priorities for houses with both hip and gable roof ends, and the 15 percent of the cost of roof replacement is sufficient to complete all of the prioritized elements pursuant to this section, but is not sufficient to complete all of the non-prioritized elements, then no portion of complete retrofit of the non-prioritized element is required."
