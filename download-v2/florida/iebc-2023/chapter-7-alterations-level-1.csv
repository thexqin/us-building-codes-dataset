This anchorage shall be accomplished by installing 1/4-inch diameter masonry screws, each with supplementary 1/4-inch washer, having sufficient length to develop a 21/2 inch (64 mm) embedment into the concrete and masonry. These screws shall be installed within 4 inches (102 mm) of the truss or rafter on both sides of each interior rafter or truss and on the accessible wall side of the gable end truss or rafter."

The hip rafter (commonly known as a ""king jack""), the hip girder and the rafters/trusses adjacent to the hip girder that are not anchored with a strap having at least four fasteners on each end, shall be connected to the top plate below using a strap or a right angle gusset bracket having a minimum uplift capacity of 500 pounds (226.8 kg). Adding fasteners to existing straps shall be allowed in lieu of adding a new strap provided the strap is manufactured to accommodate at least 4 fasteners at each end. Wherever access makes it possible (without damage of the wall or soffit finishes), both top plate members shall be connected to the stud below using a stud to plate connector with a minimum uplift capacity of 500 pounds (226.8 kg). Use of straps that connect directly from the hip rafter, hip girder or adjacent rafters/trusses to the wall stud below shall be allowed as an alternate provided the two members align with no more than 11/2 inch (38 mm) offset."

The hip rafter (commonly known as a ""king jack""), the hip girder and the rafters/trusses adjacent to the hip girder that are not anchored with a strap having at least four fasteners on each end, shall be connected to the concrete masonry wall below using approved straps or right angle gusset brackets with a minimum uplift capacity of 500 pounds (226.8 kg). Adding fasteners to existing straps shall be allowed in lieu of adding a new strap provided the strap is manufactured to accommodate at least 4 fasteners at each end. The straps or right angle gusset brackets shall be installed such that they connect each rafter or truss to the top plate below or directly to the masonry wall using approved masonry screws of a length and diameter recommended by the manufacturer. In the absence of manufacturer's recommendations, screws shall provide at least a 21/2-inch (64 mm) embedment into the concrete or masonry. When the straps or right angle gusset brackets are attached to a wood sill plate, the sill plate shall be anchored to the concrete masonry wall below.

706.8.1.7,Section 706 Existing Roofing,Priorities for Mandated Roof-to-Wall Retrofit Expenditures,,,,,,"Priority shall be given to connecting the exterior corners of roofs to walls where the spans of the roofing members are greatest. For houses with both hip and gable roof ends, the priority shall be to retrofit the gable end roof-to-wall connections unless the width of the hip end is more than 1.5 times greater than the width of the gable end. When considering priorities for houses with both hip and gable roof ends, and the fifteen percent of the cost of roof replacement is sufficient to complete all of the prioritized elements pursuant to this section, but is not sufficient to complete all of the non-prioritized elements, then no portion of complete retrofit of the non-prioritized element is required."
