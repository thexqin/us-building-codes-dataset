Exterior wall stud size and thickness shall be determined in accordance with the limits set forth in Tables R603.3.2(2) through R603.3.2(16). Interior load-bearing wall stud size and thickness shall be determined in accordance with the limits set forth in Tables R603.3.2(2) through R603.3.2(16) based on an ultimate design wind speed of 115 miles per hour (51 m/s), Exposure Category B, and the building width, stud spacing and ground snow load, as appropriate. Fastening requirements shall be in accordance with Section R603.2.5 and Table R603.3.2(1). Top and bottom tracks shall have the same minimum thickness as the wall studs. Exterior wall studs shall be permitted to be reduced to the next thinner size, as shown in Tables R603.3.2(2) through R603.3.2(16), but not less than 33 mils (0.84 mm), where both of the following conditions exist: Minimum of 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) gypsum board is installed and fastened on the interior surface in accordance with Section R702. Wood structural sheathing panels of minimum 7/16-inch-thick (11.1 mm) oriented strand board or 15/32-inch-thick (12 mm) plywood are installed and fastened in accordance with Section R603.9.1 and Table R603.3.2(1) on the outside surface. Interior load-bearing walls shall be permitted to be reduced to the next thinner size, as shown in Tables R603.3.2(2) through R603.3.2(16), but not less than 33 mils (0.84 mm), where not less than 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) gypsum board is installed and fastened in accordance with Section R702 on both sides of the wall. The tabulated stud thickness for load-bearing walls shall be used where the attic load is 10 pounds per square foot (480 Pa) or less. A limited attic storage load of 20 pounds per square foot (960 Pa) shall be permitted provided that the next higher snow load column is used to select the stud size from Tables R603.3.2(2) through R603.3.2(16). For two-story buildings, the tabulated stud thickness for walls supporting one floor, roof and ceiling shall be used where the second-floor live load is 30 pounds per square foot (1440 Pa). Second-floor live loads of 40 psf (1920 Pa) shall be permitted provided that the next higher snow load column is used to select the stud size from Tables R603.3.2(2) through R603.3.2(11). For three-story buildings, the tabulated stud thickness for walls supporting one or two floors, roof and ceiling shall be used where the third-floor live load is 30 pounds per square foot (1440 Pa). Third-floor live loads of 40 pounds per square foot (1920 Pa) shall be permitted provided that the next higher snow load column is used to select the stud size from Tables R603.3.2(12) through R603.3.2(16).

Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 28.4-1 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet, topographic factor, Kzt, equal to 1.0, and Risk Category II. For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the unreduced length, UR, of solid wall length required in each endwall. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building. Tabulated lengths in the ""minimum"" column are based on the requirement of Section 28.4.4 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum pressure of 16 psf multiplied by the wall area of the building and 8 psf multiplied by the roof area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the ""minimum"" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R608.7.1.1. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R608.7.1.1(4). The reduced length shall be not less than the ""minimum"" value shown in the table. Tabulated lengths for ""one story or top story of two story"" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for ""first story of two story"" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in this table or Table R608.7.1.1(2) or (3), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R608.7.1.1(5). Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6). The reduction factors, R1, R2 and R3, in Tables R608.7.1.1(4), R608.7.1.1(5), and R608.7.1.1(6), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid wall segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R608.7.1 and R608.7.2.1, respectively. For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.

Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 28.4-1 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet, topographic factor, Kzt, equal to 1.0, and Risk Category II. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each sidewall. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the unreduced length, UR, of solid wall length required in each sidewall. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building. Tabulated lengths in the ""minimum"" column are based on the requirement of Section 28.4.4 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum pressure of 16 psf multiplied by the wall area of the building and 8 psf multiplied by the roof area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the ""minimum"" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R608.7.1.1. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R608.7.1.1(4). The reduced length shall be not less than the ""minimum"" value shown in the table. Tabulated lengths for ""one story or top story of two story"" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for ""first story of two story"" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in this table or Table R608.7.1.1(1) or Table R608.7.1.1(2), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R608.7.1.1(5). Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R608.7.1.1(6). The reduction factors, R1, R2 and R3, in Table R608.7.1.1(4), Table R608.7.1.1(5), and Table R608.7.1.1(6), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid walls segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R608.7.1 and R608.7.2.1, respectively. For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.

Note: Top and bottom reinforcement for lintels without stirrups, as shown in shaded cells, shall be equal to or greater than that required for lintel of the same depth and loading condition that has an allowable clear span that is equal to or greater than that of the lintel without stirrups. See Table R608.3 for tolerances permitted from nominal thickness. Table values are based on concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 2,500 psi. See Note j. Table values are based on uniform loading. See Section R608.8.2 for lintels supporting concentrated loads. Deflection criterion is L/240, where L is the clear span of the lintel in inches, or 1/2 inch, whichever is less. Linear interpolation is permitted between ground snow loads and between lintel depths. DR indicates design required. Lintel depth, D, is permitted to include the available height of wall located directly above the lintel, provided that the increased lintel depth spans the entire length of the lintel. Stirrups shall be fabricated from reinforcing bars with the same yield strength as that used for the main longitudinal reinforcement.

Top and bottom reinforcement for lintels without stirrups shall be not less than the least amount of reinforcement required for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition with stirrups. All other spans require stirrups spaced at not more than d/2. Where concrete with a minimum specified compressive strength of 3,000 psi is used, clear spans for lintels without stirrups shall be permitted to be multiplied by 1.05. If the increased span exceeds the allowable clear span for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition with stirrups, the top and bottom reinforcement shall be equal to or greater than that required for a lintel of the same depth and loading condition that has an allowable clear span that is equal to or greater than that of the lintel without stirrups that has been increased. Center distance, A, is the center portion of the clear span where stirrups are not required. This is applicable to all longitudinal bar sizes and steel yield strengths.
