12,,Historic Buildings,Wall|Roof|Slab|Door|Window,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Residential (R)|Mercantile (M),sd|dd|cd,special_construction,architect,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 12 provides some exceptions from code requirements when the building in question has historic value. The most important criterion for application of this chapter is that the building must be essentially accredited as being of historic significance by a state or local authority after careful review of the historical value of the building. Most, if not all, states have such authorities, as do many local jurisdictions. The agencies with such authority can be located at the state or local government level or through the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Other considerations include the structural condition of the building (i.e., is the building structurally sound), its proposed use, its impact on life safety and how the intent of the code, if not the letter, will be achieved."

For buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, a description of the vertical and horizontal elements of the lateral force-resisting system and strengths or weaknesses therein shall be included. Additionally, the report shall describe the components of the building that provide a level of safety substantially below that required of existing nonhistoric buildings.Exception: An investigation, evaluation and report shall not be required where the alteration is scoped by Section 602 as a Level 1 alteration and does not make the building or structure less compliant with the provisions of the Building Code of New York State."
