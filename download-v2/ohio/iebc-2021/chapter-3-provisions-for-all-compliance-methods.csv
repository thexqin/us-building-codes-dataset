In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order: An accessible entrance; An accessible route to the altered area; At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; Accessible telephones; Accessible drinking fountains; When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms. Series of smaller alterations. The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel is not to be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking. If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period is to be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate."
