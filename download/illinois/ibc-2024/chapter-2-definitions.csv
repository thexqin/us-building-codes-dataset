2,,Definitions,"User notes:About this chapter: Codes, by their very nature, are technical documents. Every word, term and punctuation mark can add to or change the meaning of a technical requirement. It is necessary to maintain a consensus on the specific meaning of each term contained in the code. Chapter 2 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purposes of the code.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [A], [BG] or [BS] will be considered by one of the code development committees meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.",BuildingElementProxy,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Factory and Industrial (F)|Residential (R),concept|sd|dd|cd,occupancy_classification,architect
