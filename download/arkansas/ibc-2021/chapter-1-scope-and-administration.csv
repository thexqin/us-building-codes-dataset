1,,Scope and Administration,"User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Sections 101—102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103—116). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable. Standards and codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section 102.4). This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with maintaining ""due process of law"" in enforcing the building performance criteria contained in the body of the code. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the Administrative Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.",,,,,
