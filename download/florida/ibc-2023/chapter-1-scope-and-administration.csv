105.3.1.2,Section 105 Permits,105.3.1.2,"No permit may be issued for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair, or addition unless the applicant for such permit provides to the enforcing agency which issues the permit any of the following documents which apply to the construction for which the permit is to be issued and which shall be prepared by or under the direction of an engineer registered under Chapter 471, Florida Statutes: Plumbing documents for any new building or addition which requires a plumbing system with more than 250 fixture units or which costs more than $125,000. Fire sprinkler documents for any new building or addition which includes a fire sprinkler system which contains 50 or more sprinkler heads. Personnel as authorized by chapter 633 Florida Statutes, may design a new fire sprinkler system of 49 or fewer heads; may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition or deletion of 49 heads or fewer, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system; or may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation or deletion of 249 or fewer sprinklers and the addition of up to 49 sprinklers, as long as the cumulative total number of fire sprinklers being added, relocated, or deleted does not exceed 249, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system, if there is no change of occupancy of the affected areas, as defined in this Code and the Florida Fire Prevention Code, and there is no change in the water demand as defined in NFPA 13, ""Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems,"" and if the occupancy hazard classification as defined in NFPA 13 is reduced or remains the same as a result of the alteration. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning documents for any new building or addition which requires more than a 15-ton-per-system capacity which is designed to accommodate 100 or more persons or for which the system costs more than $125,000. This paragraph does not include any document for the replacement or repair of an existing system in which the work does not require altering a structural part of the building or for work on a residential one-, two-, three-, or four-family structure.An air-conditioning system may be designed by an installing air-conditioning contractor certified under Chapter 489, Florida Statutes, to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an air-conditioning system with a value of $125,000 or less; and when a 15-ton-per system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15-ton system or less has an independent duct system. Systems not complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer. Example 1: When a space has two 10-ton systems with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each unit (system) is less than 15 tons. Example 2: Consider a small single-story office building which consists of six individual offices where each office has a single three-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air-conditioning work is $47,000 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. Because the six mechanical units are connected to a common water tower, this is considered to be an 18-ton system. Note: It was further clarified by the Commission that the limiting criteria of 100 persons and $125,000 apply to the building occupancy load and the cost for the total air-conditioning system of the building. Any specialized mechanical, electrical, or plumbing document for any new building or addition which includes a medical gas, oxygen, steam, vacuum, toxic air filtration, halon, or fire detection and alarm system which costs more than $5,000. Exception: Simplified permitting processes. — As used in this section, the term: ""Alteration"" means to add, install, relocate, replace, or remove. ""Component"" means valves, fire sprinklers, escutcheons, hangers, compressors, or any other item deemed acceptable by the local enforcing agency. For purposes of this paragraph, a valve does not include pressure-regulating, pressure-reducing, or pressure-control valves. ""Contractor"" means a person who: Is qualified to engage in the business of electrical or alarm system contracting pursuant to a certificate or registration issued by the department under part II of chapter 489, Florida Statutes; or Is qualified to engage in the business of fire protection system contracting pursuant to a license or certificate issued by the State Fire Marshal. ""Fire alarm system project"" means a fire alarm system alteration of a total of 20 or fewer initiating devices and notification devices; the installation or replacement of a fire communicator connected to an existing fire alarm control panel in an existing commercial, residential, apartment, cooperative, or condominium building; or the replacement of an existing fire alarm panel using the same make and model as the existing panel. ""Fire sprinkler system project"" means a fire protection system alteration of a total of 20 or fewer fire sprinklers in which the sprinklers are of the same K-factor and located in spaces where there is no change of hazard classification or increased system coverage area, or the installation or replacement of an equivalent fire sprinkler system component in an existing commercial, residential, apartment, cooperative, or condominium building. For purposes of this paragraph, a component is equivalent if the component has the same or better characteristics, including electrical, hydraulic, pressure losses, and required listings and spacing as the component being replaced. A local enforcement agency may require a contractor, as a condition of obtaining a permit for a fire alarm system project or fire sprinkler system project, to submit a completed application and payment. A local enforcement agency may not require a contractor to submit plans or specifications as a condition of obtaining a permit for a fire alarm system project or fire sprinkler system project. A local enforcement agency must issue a permit for a fire alarm system project or fire sprinkler system project in person or electronically within 2 business days after submission of a completed application. A contractor may commence work authorized by the permit immediately after submission of a completed application. The local enforcement agency must provide an inspection within 3 business days after such inspection is requested, to ensure compliance with applicable codes and standards. If a fire alarm system project or fire sprinkler system project fails an inspection, the contractor must take corrective action as necessary to pass inspection. For a fire alarm system project, a contractor must keep a copy of the plans and specifications at the fire alarm system project worksite and make such plans and specifications available to the inspector for an onsite plans review at each inspection. If the local enforcement agency determines that it needs additional documents for recording purposes, the contractor must provide such documentation in paper or electronic form to the local enforcement agency within 4 business days after the inspection or 4 days after the documentation is requested, whichever is later. The local enforcement agency may not require additional plans reviews or documentation of areas or devices outside the scope of permitted work, as needed on permit applications. For a fire sprinkler system project, a contractor must keep a copy of the plans and specifications at the fire sprinkler system project worksite and make such plans and specifications available to the inspector at each inspection. If the local enforcement agency determines that it needs additional documents for recording purposes, the contractor must provide such documentation in paper or electronic form to the local enforcement agency within 4 business days after the inspection or 4 days after the documentation is requested, whichever is later.
