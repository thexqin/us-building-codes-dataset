For secondary roof structural members supporting formed metal roofing, the live load deflection shall not exceed l/150. For secondary wall members supporting formed metal siding, the design wind load deflection shall not exceed l/90. For roofs, this exception only applies when the metal sheets have no roof covering.

The deflection criterion for interior partitions is based on the horizontal load defined in Section 1607.15. See Section 2403 for glass supports. The deflection limit for the D+L load combination only applies to the deflection due to the creep component of long-term dead load deflection plus the short-term live load deflection.

For lumber and glued laminated timber members installed or used at all other moisture conditions or cross-laminated timber and wood structural panels that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection is permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from D. The value of 0.5D shall not be used in combination with ANSI/AWC NDS provisions for long-term loading. The above deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have sufficient slope or camber to ensure adequate drainage shall be investigated for ponding.

1626.3.6,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.3.6,,,,,,"In the case of glazing, after completion of the small missile impacts, each test specimen shall then be subjected to the cyclic pressure loading defined in Table 1626."
1626.3.6.1,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.3.6.1,,,,,,"If external protection devices are employed to protect windows, doors or skylights, they must resist the small missile impacts specified in Sections 1626.3.3 and 1626.3.4 without deformations that result in contact with the windows, glass, doors or skylights they are intended to protect."
1626.3.6.2,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.3.6.2,,,,,,"If external protection devices are not designed to be airtight, following the small missile impact test, they must resist an application of force corresponding to those listed in Table 1625.4 (fatigue load testing) without detaching from their mountings. The acting pressure cycles shall be simulated with loads applied through a mechanical system attached to the shutter specimen to apply uniformly around the shutter perimeter a force equal to the product of the required pressure and the area of the shutter specimen."
1626.3.7,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.3.7,,,,,,"If air leakage through the test specimen is excessive, tape may be used to cover any cracks and joints through which leakage is occurring. Tape shall not be used when there is a probability that it may significantly restrict differential movement between adjoining members. It is also permissible to cover both sides of the entire specimen and mounting panel with a single thickness of polyethylene film no thicker than 0.050 mm (2 mils). The technique of application is important for the full load to be transferred to the specimen and to insure the membrane does not prevent movement or failure of the specimen. Apply the film loosely with extra folds of material at each corner and at all offsets and recesses. When the load is applied, there shall be no fillet caused by tightness of plastic film."
1626.3.8,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.3.8,,,,,,A particular system of construction shall be deemed to comply with this test if three test specimens reject the small missile impacts without penetration and resist the cyclic pressure loading with no crack forming longer than 5 inches (127 mm) and 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) in width through which air can pass.
1626.3.9,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.3.9,,,,,,"If only one of the three test specimens in a test fails to meet the previously listed criteria, one retest of the system (another test sequence with three specimens) of construction shall be permitted."
1626.4,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,Construction Assemblies Deemed to Comply With Section 1626,,,,,,"Exterior concrete masonry walls of minimum nominal 8-inch (203 mm) thickness, constructed in accordance with Chapter 21 (High-Velocity Hurricane Zones) of this code.Exterior frame walls or gable ends constructed in accordance with Chapters 22 and 23 (High-Velocity Hurricane Zones) of this code, sheathed with a minimum 19/32-inch (15 mm) CD exposure 1 plywood and clad with wire lath and stucco installed in accordance with Chapter 25 of this code.Exterior frame walls and roofs constructed in accordance with Chapter 22 (High-Velocity Hurricane Zones) of this code sheathed with a minimum 24-gage rib-deck-type material and clad with an approved wall finish.Exterior reinforced concrete elements constructed of solid normal weight concrete (no voids), designed in accordance with Chapter 19 (High-Velocity Hurricane Zones) of this code and having a minimum 2 inches (51 mm) thickness.Roof systems constructed in accordance with Chapter 22 or Chapter 23 (High-Velocity Hurricane Zones) of this code, sheathed with a minimum 19/32-inch (15 mm) CD exposure 1 plywood or minimum nominal 1-inch (25 mm) wood decking and surfaced with an approved roof system installed in accordance with Chapter 15 of this code.All connectors shall be specified by the building designer of record for all loads except impact."
1626.5.1,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.5.1,,,,,,"Louvers protecting the exterior wall envelope and are within 30 feet (9144 mm) of grade shall meet the requirements of AMCA 540 or TAS 201 (large missile test) or shall be protected by an impact-resistant cover complying with TAS 201 (large missile test), TAS 202 and TAS 203."
1626.5.2,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.5.2,,,,,,"Louvers required to be open for life safety purposes, such as providing a breathable atmosphere, that are protecting the exterior wall envelope and are within 30 feet (9144 mm) of grade shall meet the impact requirements of AMCA 540 or TAS 201 (large missile test)."
1626.5.3,Section 1626 High-Velocity Hurricane Zones— Impact Tests for Wind-Borne Debris,1626.5.3,,,,,,"Open and closed louvers protecting the exterior wall envelope, regardless of their function or location from grade, shall also comply with uniform air pressure testing per TAS 202 protocol and either the cyclical wind pressure loading per TAS 203 protocol or by complying with both the impact and cyclical pressure testing of AMCA 540."
