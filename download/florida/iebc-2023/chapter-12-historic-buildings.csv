1207.2,Section 1207 Historic Cuban Tile,1207.2,,,,,,"Handmade or hand process made barrel (""C""-shaped) natural clay tile, often variegated in color, either manufactured in the Republic of Cuba prior to the imposition of the U.S. Embargo, or, in the case of antique tile, manufactured in 18th century Spain, salvaged from buildings in Cuba and imported to the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Identification. Final responsibility for the identification of historic Cuban tile shall rest with the building official, subject to the appeals process established by the authority having jurisdiction. Historic Cuban tile is generally identified in the following manner: Tile bearing an embossed identification mark usually located on the convex side at the wide taper end of the tile, the most common of which are: ""C.E. SAÑUDO MADE IN CUBA""; ""JAIME MADE IN CUBA""; ""FLORIDO""; ""st ANA R.S.""; ""St. FELIPE""; ""MIA""; ""CPS""; ""C""; ""D""; ""DD""; ""DDD""; ""M""; [script] ""M""; [script] ""JS""; ""S""; ""SS""; ""TZ""; ""Z""; ""ZZ""; ""*"", a nonalphabetical symbol (such as the ""delta"" figure created by three finger-tip impressions in a triangular position), or a distinctive physical characteristic (such as a burlap material impression over the convex surface of the tile or finger-made impression band(s) located across the end lap of the convex surface); and Tile not bearing an embossed identification mark, a nonalphabetical symbol or a distinctive physical characteristic(s) listed in Item 1 above but determined by official action of the legally constituted historic preservation board or historic preservation officer of the jurisdiction to be antique Cuban tile of Spanish origin or tile manufactured in preembargo Cuba. Reapplication of historic Cuban tile-method. When a structure which bore historic Cuban tile when originally constructed is reroofed, reapplication of historic Cuban tile, rather than replacement with new contemporary tile, is preferred and shall be encouraged by the building official. When historic Cuban tile is reapplied under the circumstances described above, except as otherwise provided herein, all of the requirements of this code, especially Chapter 15 of the Florida Building Code, Building relating to roof covering and application, shall apply. In addition, the following reapplication methods shall be observed: Attachment. Historic Cuban tile shall be mortar set or adhesive set to the deck in the same manner as other product approved handmade clay barrel tile, in accordance with RAS 120. Use with contemporary tile. Where, during removal, the salvage ratio of the historic Cuban tile is less than 100 percent, it is preferred that the replacement cap tile also be historic Cuban tile. Where this is not practical or possible, during reapplication, the salvaged historic Cuban tile shall be used only as cap tile, and not as pan tile. The historic Cuban tile should always be reapplied to distinctive architectural elements such as walls, parapets and chimneys. Where contemporary barrel tile is used to supplement salvaged historic Cuban tile, the contemporary barrel tile shall be product approved and otherwise comply with all the requirements of this code. It is preferred that the contemporary barrel tile, when used as cap tile, be handmade natural clay tile, but, in any event, it shall be the same shape, color and texture as the existing historic Cuban tile. Because the salvage ratio of pan tile is low and because pan tile is much less visible, reapplication of historic Cuban tile as a pan tile is discouraged. Rather, it is preferred that pan tile be contemporary barrel tile of either handmade clay, vitrified clay or cement. Mixing dissimilar tiles. Mixing dissimilar tile styles or shapes, such as an ""S""-shaped tile with the ""C""-shaped historic Cuban barrel tile, even on separate roofing surfaces of the same structure, shall be avoided. In no case shall dissimilar tile styles or shapes be permitted on the same roofing surface. Double caps and/or pans on the eave roof line. For reinforcement during routine maintenance and for aesthetic purposes, double caps, double pans or both shall be encouraged on the eave roof line, especially where extant or historical evidence of the original installation indicates the use of this historic technique. Inspection and testing of the installation. Installations of salvaged and reapplied historic Cuban tile, as are specifically permitted in this section, shall be subject to each and every inspection and test otherwise required in this code for a barrel tile mortar set or adhesive set installation. Exemption from product control and testing requirements. Historic Cuban tile, when salvaged and reapplied, as otherwise provided in this section, to a roof that historically bore such material, is exempt from the product approval and preinstallation physical testing requirements of this code. However, the completed installation shall be subject to each and every inspection and test otherwise required of a barrel tile mortar set or adhesive set installation, and, further, if contemporary barrel tile is used to supplement historic Cuban tile, the contemporary tile shall be product approved and comply with all requirements of this code."
