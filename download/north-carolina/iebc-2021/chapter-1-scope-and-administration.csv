104.10.1,Section 104 Duties and Powers of Code Official,Flood Hazard Areas,"For existing buildings located in flood hazard areas for which repairs, alterations and additions constitute substantial improvement, the code official shall not grant modifications to provisions related to flood resistance unless a determination is made that: The applicant has presented approved documentation that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the site render compliance with the flood resistant construction provisions inappropriate. Failure to grant the modification would result in exceptional hardship as demonstrated by the applicant and approved by the code official. See Appendix G, Flood Resistant Construction, of the International Building Code. The granting of the modification will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or ordinances as demonstrated by the applicant and approved by the code official. See Appendix G, Flood Resistant Construction, of the International Building Code. The modification is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard. A written notice will be provided by the code official to the applicant specifying, if applicable, the difference between the design flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation and that construction below the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property. Local ordinances more restrictive than the requirements of this section supersede these requirements.",,,,,
