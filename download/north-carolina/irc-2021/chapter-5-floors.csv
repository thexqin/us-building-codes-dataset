5,,Floors,"User note:About this chapter: Chapter 5 provides the requirements for the design and construction of floor systems that will be capable of supporting minimum required design loads. This chapter covers wood floor framing, wood floors on the ground, cold-formed steel floor framing and concrete slabs on the ground. Allowable span tables are provided that greatly simplify the determination of joist, girder and sheathing sizes for raised floor systems of wood framing and cold-formed steel framing. This chapter also contains prescriptive requirements for wood-framed exterior decks and their attachment to the main building.",Slab|Beam|Member,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Factory and Industrial (F)|Residential (R),sd|dd|cd,structural_design,structural_engineer
