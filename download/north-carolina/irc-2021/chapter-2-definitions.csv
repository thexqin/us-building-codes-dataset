2,,Definitions,"User notes: About this chapter: Codes, by their very nature, are technical documents. Every word, term and punctuation mark can add to or change the meaning of a technical requirement. It is necessary to maintain a consensus on the specific meaning of each term contained in the code. Chapter 2 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purpose of the code. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to definitions in this chapter preceded by a bracketed letter are considered by the IRC—Building Code Development Committee [RB], the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee [MP] or the IECC—Residential Code Development Committee [RE] during the Group B (2022) Code Development Cycle.",BuildingElementProxy,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Factory and Industrial (F)|Residential (R),concept|sd|dd|cd,occupancy_classification,architect
