In addition to a foundation's ability to support the required design loads, this chapter addresses several other factors that can affect foundation performance. These include controlling surface water and subsurface drainage, requiring soil tests where conditions warrant and evaluating proximity to slopes and minimum depth requirements. This chapter also provides requirements to minimize adverse effects of moisture, decay and pests in basements and crawl spaces."
