30,,Sanitary Drainage,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 30 regulates methods and piping systems that remove water that has been used for purposes such as flushing water closets, bathing, culinary activities and equipment discharges. The types of materials, drainage fitting and connection methods for these systems, beginning at the receiving fixtures and ending at the point of disposal for the liquid waste, are covered. A design method for a gravity flow system of vertical and horizontal piping is provided based on the probability of flows from specific fixtures.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.",,,,,
