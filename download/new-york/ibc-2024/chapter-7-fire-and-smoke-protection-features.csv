Staples with equivalent holding power and penetration shall be permitted to be used as alternate fasteners to nails for attachment to wood framing. Thickness shown for brick and clay tile is nominal thicknesses unless plastered, in which case thicknesses are net. Thickness shown for concrete masonry and clay masonry is equivalent thickness defined in Section 722.3.1 for concrete masonry and Section 722.4.1.1 for clay masonry. Where all cells are solid grouted or filled with silicone-treated perlite loose-fill insulation; vermiculite loose-fill insulation; or expanded clay, shale or slate lightweight aggregate, the equivalent thickness shall be the thickness of the block or brick using specified dimensions as defined in Chapter 21. Equivalent thickness shall include the thickness of applied plaster and lath or gypsum wallboard, where specified. For units in which the net cross-sectional area of cored brick in any plane parallel to the surface containing the cores is not less than 75 percent of the gross cross-sectional area measured in the same plane. Shall be used for nonbearing purposes only. For all of the construction with gypsum wallboard described in this table, gypsum base for veneer plaster of the same size, thickness and core type shall be permitted to be substituted for gypsum wallboard, provided that attachment is identical to that specified for the wallboard, and the joints on the face layer are reinforced and the entire surface is covered with not less than 1/16-inch gypsum veneer plaster.

The fire-resistance rating of concrete masonry units composed of a combination of aggregate types or where plaster is applied directly to the concrete masonry shall be determined in accordance with ACI 216.1/TMS 216. Lightweight aggregates shall have a maximum combined density of 65 pounds per cubic foot. See Note b.

Wood structural panels shall be permitted to be installed between the fire protection and the wood studs on either the interior or exterior side of the wood frame assemblies in this table, provided that the length of the fasteners used to attach the fire protection is increased by an amount not less than the thickness of the wood structural panel. For studs with a slenderness ratio, le/d, greater than 33, the design stress shall be reduced to 78 percent of allowable F'c. For studs with a slenderness ratio, le/d, not exceeding 33, the design stress shall be reduced to 78 percent of the adjusted stress F' c calculated for studs having a slenderness ratio le/d of 33.
