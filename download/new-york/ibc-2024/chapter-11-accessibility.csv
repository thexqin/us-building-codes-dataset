11,,Accessibility,"User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility of buildings and their associated sites and facilities for people with physical disabilities. The fundamental philosophy of the code on the subject of accessibility is that everything is required to be accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1). The code's scoping requirements then address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of exceptions to this general mandate. While the BCNYS contains scoping provisions for accessibility (for example, what, where and how many), ICC A117.1, Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, is the referenced standard for the technical provisions (in other words, how). Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the Existing Building Code of New York State. The Residential Code of New York State references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter may be applicable to housing covered under the Residential Code of New York State. The provisions in the NYS Codes are intended to meet or exceed the requirements in the federal accessibility requirement found in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act. There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a tangible benefit to people without disabilities. This type of requirement can be set forth in the code as generally applicable without necessarily identifying it specifically as an accessibility-related issue. Such a requirement would then be considered as having been ""mainstreamed."" For example, visible alarms are located in Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed in Chapter 10.",Door|Ramp|Stair|Window|Slab,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Institutional (I)|Residential (R),sd|dd|cd,accessibility,architect
