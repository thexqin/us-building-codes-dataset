M2202,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,"Oil Piping, Fitting and Connections",,,,,,
M2202.1,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Materials,"Piping shall consist of steel pipe, copper and copper alloy pipe and tubing or steel tubing conforming to ASTM A 539. Aluminum tubing shall not be used between the fuel-oil tank and the burner units.",,,,,
M2202.2,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Joints and Fittings,"Piping shall be connected with standard fittings compatible with the piping material. Cast iron fittings shall not be used for oil piping. Unions requiring gaskets or packings, right or left couplings, and sweat fittings employing solder having a melting point less than 1,000°F (538°C) shall not be used for oil piping. Threaded joints and connections shall be made tight with a lubricant or pipe thread compound.",,,,,
M2202.3,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Flexible Connectors,Flexible metallic hoses shall be listed and labeled in accordance with UL 536 and shall be installed in accordance with their listing and labeling and the manufacturer's installation instructions. Connectors made from combustible materials shall not be used inside of buildings or above ground outside of buildings.,,,,,
M2203,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Installation,,,,,,
M2203.1,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,General,"Piping shall be installed in a manner to avoid placing stresses on the piping, and to accommodate expansion and contraction of the piping system.",,,,,
M2203.2,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Supply Piping,Supply piping used in the installation of oil burners and appliances shall be not smaller than 3/8-inch (9 mm) pipe or 3/8-inch (9 mm) outside diameter tubing. Copper tubing and fittings shall be a minimum of Type L.,,,,,
M2203.3,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Fill Piping,Fill piping shall terminate outside of buildings at a point not less than 2 feet (610 mm) from any building opening at the same or lower level. Fill openings shall be equipped with a tight metal cover.,,,,,
M2203.4,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Vent Piping,"Vent piping shall be not smaller than 11/4-inch (32 mm) pipe. Vent piping shall be laid to drain toward the tank without sags or traps in which the liquid can collect. Vent pipes shall not be cross connected with fill pipes, lines from burners or overflow lines from auxiliary tanks. The lower end of a vent pipe shall enter the tank through the top and shall extend into the tank not more than 1 inch (25 mm).",,,,,
M2203.5,Chapter 22 Special Piping and Storage Systems,Vent Termination,"Vent piping shall terminate outside of buildings at a point not less than 2 feet (610 mm), measured vertically or horizontally, from any building opening. Outer ends of vent piping shall terminate in a weather-proof cap or fitting having an unobstructed area at least equal to the cross-sectional area of the vent pipe, and shall be located sufficiently above the ground to avoid being obstructed by snow and ice.",,,,,
