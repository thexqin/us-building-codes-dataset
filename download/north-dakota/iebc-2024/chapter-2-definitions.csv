2,,Definitions,"User notes:About this chapter: Codes, by their very nature, are technical documents. Every word, term and punctuation mark can add to or change the meaning of a technical requirement. It is necessary to maintain a consensus on the specific meaning of each term contained in the code. Chapter 2 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purpose of the code.",BuildingElementProxy,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Factory and Industrial (F)|Residential (R),concept|sd|dd|cd|ca,occupancy_classification,architect
