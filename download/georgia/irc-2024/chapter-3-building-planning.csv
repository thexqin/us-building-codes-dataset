The effective wind area shall be equal to the span length multiplied by an effective width. This width shall be not less than one-third the span length. For cladding fasteners, the effective wind areas shall not be greater than the area that is tributary to an individual fastener. For effective areas between those given, the load shall be interpolated or the load associated with the lower effective areas shall be used. Table values shall be adjusted for height and exposure by multiplying by the adjustment coefficient in Table R301.2.1(2). See Figure R301.2.1 for locations of zones. Plus and minus signs signify pressures acting toward and away from the building surfaces. Positive and negative design wind pressures shall not be less than 10 psf. Roof overhang loads shall be determined by summing the applicable roof zone pressure with the adjacent wall zone pressure.

R301.2.1.1,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Wind Limitations and Wind Design Required,"The wind provisions of this code shall not apply to the design of buildings where wind design is required in accordance with Figure R301.2.1.1, or where the ultimate design wind speed, Vult, in Figure R301.2(2) equals or exceeds 140 miles per hour (225 kph) in a special wind region. Exceptions: For concrete construction, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Sections R404 and R608. For structural insulated panels, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Section R610. For cold-formed steel light-frame construction, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Sections R505, R603 and R804. In regions where wind design is required in accordance with Figure R301.2.1.1 or where the ultimate design wind speed, Vult, in Figure R301.2(2) equals or exceeds 140 miles per hour (225 kph) in a special wind region, the design of buildings for wind loads shall be in accordance with one or more of the following methods: AWC Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM). ICC Standard for Residential Construction in High-Wind Regions (ICC 600). ASCE Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE 7).

For a site located in the transition zone between categories, the category resulting in the largest wind forces shall apply. Account shall be taken of variations in ground surface roughness that arise from natural topography and vegetation as well as from constructed features. For a site where multiple detached one- and two-family dwellings, townhouses or other structures are to be constructed as part of a subdivision or master-planned community, or are otherwise designated as a developed area by the authority having jurisdiction, the exposure category for an individual structure shall be based on the site conditions that will exist at the time when all adjacent structures on the site have been constructed, provided that their construction is expected to begin within 1 year of the start of construction for the structure for which the exposure category is determined. For any given wind direction, the exposure in which a specific building or other structure is sited shall be assessed as being one of the following categories: Exposure B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger.
