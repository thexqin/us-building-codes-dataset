8,,Interior Finishes,Wall|Ceiling|Slab|Covering|BuildingElementProxy,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Institutional (I)|Residential (R),sd|dd|cd,finishes_materials,architect,User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 8 contains the performance requirements for controlling fire growth and smoke propagation within buildings by restricting interior finish and decorative materials. The provisions of this chapter require materials used as interior finishes and decorations to meet certain flame spread index or flame propagation criteria and smoke development criteria based on the relative fire hazard associated with the occupancy. The performance of the material is evaluated based on test standards.
