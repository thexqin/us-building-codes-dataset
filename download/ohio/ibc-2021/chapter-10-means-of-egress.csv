10,,Means of Egress,Stair|Ramp|Door|Wall|Slab,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Residential (R)|Institutional (I),sd|dd|cd,means_of_egress,architect,"User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified. The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 is subdivided into four main sections: general (Sections 1003—1015), exit access (Sections 1016—1021), exit (Sections 1022—1027) and exit discharge (Sections 1028—1029). Special allowances for the unique requirements for assembly spaces (Section 1030) and emergency escape and rescue openings (Section 1031) complete the chapter. Chapter 10 of this code is duplicated in Chapter 10 of the International Fire Code®; however, the International Fire Code contains one additional section on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings. Section 1010 was extensively reorganized for the 2021 edition. For complete information, see the moved sections table in the preface information for the International Building Code."
