The installation of vents serving listed appliances with vent dampers shall be in accordance with the appliance manufacturer's instructions or in accordance with the following: The maximum capacity of the vent connector shall be determined using the NAT Max column. The maximum capacity of the vertical vent or chimney shall be determined using the FAN+NAT column where the second appliance is a fan-assisted appliance, or the NAT+NAT column where the second appliance is equipped with a draft hood. The minimum capacity shall be determined as if the appliance were a fan-assisted appliance. The minimum capacity of the vent connector shall be determined using the FAN Min column. The FAN+FAN column shall be used where the second appliance is a fan-assisted appliance, and the FAN+NAT column shall be used where the second appliance is equipped with a draft hood, to determine whether the vertical vent or chimney configuration is not permitted (NA). Where the vent configuration is NA, the vent configuration shall not be permitted and an alternative venting configuration shall be utilized.",,,,,

G2428.3.3,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.3) Connectors With Longer Lengths,"Connectors with longer horizontal lengths than those listed in Section G2428.3.2 are permitted under the following conditions:The maximum capacity (FAN Max or NAT Max) of the vent connector shall be reduced 10 percent for each additional multiple of the length allowed by Section G2428.3.2. For example, the maximum length listed in Table G2428.3.2 for a 4-inch (102 mm) connector is 6 feet (1829 mm). With a connector length greater than 6 feet (1829 mm) but not exceeding 12 feet (3658 mm), the maximum capacity must be reduced by 10 percent (0.90 × maximum vent connector capacity). With a connector length greater than 12 feet (3658 mm), but not exceeding 18 feet (5486 mm), the maximum capacity must be reduced by 20 percent (0.80 × maximum vent capacity).For a connector serving a fan-assisted appliance, the minimum capacity (FAN Min) of the connector shall be determined by referring to the corresponding single-appliance table. For Type B double-wall connectors, Table G2428.2(1) shall be used. For single-wall connectors, Table G2428.2(2) shall be used. The height (H) and lateral (L) shall be measured according to the procedures for a single-appliance vent, as if the other appliances were not present.",,,,,
G2428.3.4,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.4) Vent Connector Manifold,"Where the vent connectors are combined prior to entering the vertical portion of the common vent to form a common vent manifold, the size of the common vent manifold and the common vent shall be determined by applying a 10-percent reduction (0.90 × maximum common vent capacity) to the common vent capacity part of the common vent tables. The length of the common vent connector manifold (Lm) shall not exceed 11/2 feet for each inch (18 mm per mm) of common vent connector manifold diameter (D).",,,,,
G2428.3.5,Chapter 24 Fuel Gas,(504.3.5) Common Vertical Vent Offset,"Where the common vertical vent is offset, the maximum capacity of the common vent shall be reduced in accordance with Section G2428.3.6. The horizontal length of the common vent offset (Lo) shall not exceed 11/2 feet for each inch (18 mm per mm) of common vent diameter (D). Where multiple offsets occur in a common vent, the total horizontal length of all offsets combined shall not exceed 11/2 feet for each inch (18 mm per mm) of the common vent diameter (D).",,,,,

For each elbow greater than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) up to and including 90 degrees (1.57 rad), the maximum common vent capacity listed in the venting tables shall be reduced by 10 percent.",,,,,
