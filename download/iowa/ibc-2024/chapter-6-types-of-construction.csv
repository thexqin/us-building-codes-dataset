6,,Types of Construction,"User notes:About this chapter: Chapter 6 establishes five types of construction in which each building must be categorized. This chapter looks at the materials used in the building (combustible or noncombustible) and the extent to which building elements such as the building frame, roof, wall and floor can resist fire. Depending on the type of construction and the specific building element, fire resistance of 1 to 3 hours is specified.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections in this chapter will be considered by one of the code development committees meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.",Wall|Roof|Slab|Beam|Column,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Residential (R)|Institutional (I),sd|dd|cd,construction_type_ratings,architect
