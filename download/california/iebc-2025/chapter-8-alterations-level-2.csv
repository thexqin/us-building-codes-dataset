User notes: About this chapter: Like Chapter 7, the purpose of this chapter is to provide detailed requirements and provisions to identify the required improvements in the existing building elements, building spaces and building structural system when a building is being altered. This chapter is distinguished from Chapters 7 and 9 by involving space reconfiguration that could be up to and including 50 percent of the area of the building. In contrast, Level 1 alterations (Chapter 7) do not involve space reconfiguration, and Level 3 alterations (Chapter 9) involve extensive space reconfiguration that exceeds 50 percent of the building area. Depending on the nature of alteration work, its location within the building, and whether it encompasses one or more tenants, improvements and upgrades could be required for the open floor penetrations, sprinkler system or the installation of additional means of egress such as stairs or fire escapes.",Wall|Slab|Stair|Door|BuildingElementProxy,Business (B)|Assembly (A)|Residential (R),sd|dd|cd,special_construction,architect

Any existing gravity load-carrying structural element whose gravity load-carrying capacity is decreased as part of the alteration shall be shown to have the capacity to resist the applicable design dead, live and snow loads, including snow drift effects, required by the California Building Code for new structures. Exceptions: Buildings of Group R occupancy with not more than five dwelling or sleeping units used solely for residential purposes where the altered building complies with the conventional light-frame construction methods of the California Building Code or the provisions of the California Residential Code.

Exceptions:Any existing lateral load-carrying structural element whose demand-capacity ratio with the alteration considered is not more than 10 percent greater than its demand-capacity ratio with the alteration ignored shall be permitted to remain unaltered. For purposes of calculating demand-capacity ratios, the demand shall consider applicable load combinations with design lateral loads or forces in accordance with Section 1609 of the California Building Code and Section 304.3.1 or 304.3.2 of this code. The same methodology shall be used for the altered and unaltered structures. For purposes of this exception, comparisons of demand-capacity ratios and calculation of design lateral loads, forces and capacities shall account for the cumulative effects of additions and alterations since original construction. When calculating demand-capacity ratios for wind, the date of original construction shall be permitted to be taken as the date of completion of a prior addition, alteration or repair in compliance with Section 1609 of the California Building Code or the code wind forces in effect at the time. When calculating demand-capacity ratios for earthquake, the date of original construction shall be permitted to be taken as the date of completion of a prior addition, alteration or repair in compliance with Section 304.3.1 or 304.3.2 Item 1 or 3 or the full or reduced seismic forces in effect at the time.Buildings in which the increase in the demand-capacity ratio is due entirely to the addition of rooftop-supported mechanical equipment individually having an operating weight less than 400 pounds (181.4 kg) and where the total additional weight of all rooftop equipment placed after initial construction of the building is less than 10 percent of the roof dead load. For purposes of this exception, ""roof"" shall mean the roof level above a particular story.Increases in the demand-capacity ratio due to lateral loads from seismic forces need not be evaluated for the installation of rooftop photovoltaic panel systems where the additional roof dead load due to the system, including ballast where applicable, does not exceed 5 pounds per square foot (psf) (0.2394 kN/m2) and does not exceed 10 percent of the dead load of the existing roof.",Wall|Beam|Column|Slab,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Residential (R)|Storage (S),sd|dd|cd,structural_design,structural_engineer

Exception: New lateral force-resisting systems designed in accordance with the California Building Code are permitted to be of a type designated as ""Ordinary"" or ""Intermediate"" where ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1 states these types of systems are not permitted.Supports and attachments for nonstructural elements removed and reinstalled to facilitate the work comply with the California Building Code for new construction.The alterations do not create a structural irregularity as defined in ASCE 7 or make an existing structural irregularity more severe.
