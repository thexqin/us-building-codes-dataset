User notes: About this chapter: This code contains numerous references to standards that are used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 16 contains a comprehensive list of all standards that are referenced in the code, including the appendices. The standards are part of the code to the extent of the reference to the standard. Compliance with the referenced standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with the code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and available on an equal basis to the building code official, contractor, designer and owner. This chapter lists the standards that are referenced in various sections of this document. The standards are listed herein by the promulgating agency of the standard, the standard identification, the effective date and title, and the section or sections of this document that reference the standard. The application of the referenced standards shall be as specified in Section 102.4, or California Administration Division 1, as applicable. [OSHPD 1] Reference to other chapters. In addition to the code sections referenced, the standards listed in this chapter are applicable to the respective code sections in Chapters 3A, 4A and 5A.

Single drops installed in the raceway to individual devices or appliances. *In a single room not exceeding 1000 feet2 (93 m2) in area, a drop installed in the raceway to multiple devices or appliances that does not include any emergency control function devices. Where the vertically run conductors are contained in a 2-hour rated cable assembly, or enclosed (installed) in a 2-hour rated enclosure or a listed circuit integrity (C.I.) cable, which meets or exceeds a 2-hour fire-resistive rating. Revise Section 14.4.6.1 as follows:14.4.6.1 Testing. Household fire alarm systems shall be tested in accordance with the manufacturer's published instructions according to the methods of Table 14.4.3.2.Revise Section 17.16 as follows:17.16 Fire Extinguisher Electronic Monitoring Device. A fire extinguisher electronic monitoring device shall indicate those conditions for a specific fire extinguisher required by California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, Chapter 1, Section 574.2(c) and California Fire Code to a fire alarm control unit.Revise Section 12.3.8 as follows:12.3.8 (4) Where the vertically run conductors are contained in a 2-hour rated cable assembly, or enclosed (installed) in a 2-hour rated enclosure or a listed circuit integrity (C.I.) cable, which meets or exceeds a 2-hour fire resistive rating.Revise Section 23.8.5.1.2 as follows:23.8.5.1.2* Where connected to a supervising station, fire alarm systems employing automatic fire detectors or waterflow detection devices shall include a manual fire alarm box to initiate a signal to the supervising station. Exception: Fire alarm systems dedicated to elevator recall control, supervisory service and fire sprinkler monitoring as permitted in Section 17.15 of NFPA 72. Revise Section 23.8.5.4.1 as follows:23.8.5.4.1 Systems equipped with alarm verification features shall be permitted under the following conditions: The alarm verification feature is not initially enabled unless conditions or occupant activities that are expected to cause nuisance alarms are anticipated in the area that is protected by the smoke detectors. Enabling of the alarm verification feature shall be protected by password or limited access. A smoke detector that is continuously subjected to a smoke concentration above alarm threshold does not delay the system functions of Sections 10.7 through 10.16, 23.8.1.1, or 21.2.1 by more than 30 seconds. Actuation of an alarm-initiating device other than a smoke detector causes the system functions of Sections 10.7 through 10.16, 23.8.1.1, or 21.2.1 without additional delay. The current status of the alarm verification feature is shown on the record of completion [see Figure 7.8.2(a), Item 4.3]. Operation of a patient room smoke detector in I-2 and R-2.1 occupancies shall not include an alarm verification feature. Revise Section 29.3.1 as follows: 29.3.1 All devices, combinations of devices and equipment to be installed in conformity with this chapter shall be approved and listed by the California State Fire Marshal for the purposes for which they are intended.Revise Section 29.5.2.1.1 as follows: 29.5.2.1.1* Smoke and Heat Alarms.
