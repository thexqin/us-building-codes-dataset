User notes: About this chapter: Chapter 7 provides the technical requirements for those existing buildings that undergo Level 1 alterations as described in Section 603, which includes replacement or covering of existing materials, elements, equipment or fixtures using new materials for the same purpose. This chapter, similar to other chapters of this code, covers all building-related subjects, such as structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and accessibility as well as the fire and life safety issues when the alterations are classified as Level 1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide detailed requirements and provisions to identify the required improvements in the existing building elements, building spaces and building structural system. This chapter is distinguished from Chapters 8 and 9 by involving only replacement of building components with new components. In contrast, Level 2 alterations involve more space reconfiguration, and Level 3 alterations involve more extensive space reconfiguration, exceeding 50 percent of the building area."
