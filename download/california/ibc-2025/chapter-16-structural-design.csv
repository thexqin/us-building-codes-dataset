In addition, this chapter assigns buildings and structures to risk categories that are indicative of their intended use. The loads specified herein along with the required load combinations have been established through research and service performance of buildings and structures.

Design for the seismic forces of Section 13.3 shall not be required for piping systems where flexible connections, expansion loops or other assemblies are provided to accommodate the relative displacement between component and piping, where the piping system is positively attached to the structure, and where any of the following conditions apply: Trapeze assemblies are supported by 3/8-inch (10 mm) or 1/2-inch (13-mm) diameter rod hangers not exceeding 12 inches (305 mm) in length from the pipe support point to the connection at the supporting structure, and no single pipe exceeds the diameter limits set forth in item 2b or 2 inches (50 mm) where Ip is greater than 1.0 and the total weight supported by any single trapeze is 100 pounds (445 N) or less; or Piping is supported by rod hangers and provisions are made to avoid impact with other structural or nonstructural components or to protect the piping in the event of such impact; or pipes are supported by individual rod hangers 3/8 inch (10 mm) or 1/2 inch (13 mm) in diameter, where each hanger in the pipe run is 12 inches (305 mm) or less in length from the pipe support point to the connection at the supporting structure, and the total weight supported by any single hanger is 50 pounds (220 N) or less. In addition, the following limitations on the size of piping shall be observed: In structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F where Ip is greater than 1.0, the nominal pipe size shall be 1 inch (25 mm) or less. In structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F where Ip = 1.0, the nominal pipe size shall be 3 inches (80 mm) or less. Pneumatic tube systems supported with trapeze assemblies using 3/8-inch (10 mm) diameter rod hangers not exceeding 12 inches (305 mm) in length from the tube support point to the connection at the supporting structure and the total weight supported by any single trapeze is 100 pounds (445 N) or less. Pneumatic tube systems supported by individual rod hangers 3/8 inch (10 mm) or 1/2 inch (13 mm) in diameter, and each hanger in the run is 12 inches (305 mm) or less in length from the tube support point to the connection at the supporting structure, and the total weight supported by any single rod is 50 pounds (220 N) or less. Flexible connections in piping required in Section 13.6.7.3 are not required where pipe is rigidly attached to the same floor or wall that provides vertical and lateral support for the equipment, or to a fixture. Flexible connections in piping are required at seismic separation joints and shall be detailed to accommodate the seismic relative displacements at connections."

Retainer plates are required at the top and bottom of the car and counterweight, except where safety devices acceptable to the enforcement agency are provided which meet all requirements of the retainer plates, including full engagement of the machined portion of the rail. The design of the car, cab stabilizers, counterweight guide rails and counterweight frames for seismic forces shall be based on the following requirements:The seismic force shall be computed per the requirements of ASCE 7, Section 13.6.11.1. The minimum horizontal acceleration shall be 0.5g allowable stress design load for all buildings.Wp shall equal the weight of the counterweight or the maximum weight of the car plus not less than 40 percent of its rated load.With the car or counterweight located in the most adverse position, the stress in the rail shall not exceed the limitations specified in these regulations, nor shall the deflection of the rail relative to its supports exceed the deflection listed below.Where guide rails are continuous over supports and rail joints are within 2 feet (610 mm) of their supporting brackets, a simple span may be assumed.The use of spreader brackets is allowed.Cab stabilizers and counterweight frames shall be designed to withstand computed lateral load with a minimum horizontal acceleration of 0.5g allowable stress design load.
