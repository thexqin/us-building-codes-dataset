User notes: About this chapter: While the balance of the chapters in this code specify how a building is to be designed and constructed in order to be in compliance with the code, Chapter 33 looks to the actual construction process. Parameters are provided for demolition and for protecting adjacent property during demolition and construction. This chapter also addresses the need for a fire watch during nonworking hours for certain buildings once the construction has progressed significantly. Issues such as how to provide egress while the building is growing, the timing of standpipe and sprinkler installation, and protection of pedestrians are addressed. ICC code development note: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.",Wall|Slab|Door|Stair|Ramp,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Residential (R)|Educational (E)|Mercantile (M),cd|ca,special_construction,architect
