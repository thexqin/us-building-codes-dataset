The effective wind area shall be equal to the span length multiplied by an effective width. This width shall be not less than one-third the span length. For cladding fasteners, the effective wind areas shall not be greater than the area that is tributary to an individual fastener. For effective areas between those given, the load shall be interpolated or the load associated with the lower effective areas shall be used. Table values shall be adjusted for height and exposure by multiplying by the adjustment coefficient in Table R301.2.1(2). See Figure R301.2.1 for locations of zones. Plus and minus signs signify pressures acting toward and away from the building surfaces. Positive and negative design wind pressures shall not be less than 10 psf. Roof overhang loads shall be determined by summing the applicable roof zone pressure with the adjacent wall zone pressure.

R301.2.1.1,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Wind Limitations and Wind Design Required,"The wind provisions of this code shall not apply to the design of buildings where wind design is required in accordance with Figure R301.2.1.1, or where the ultimate design wind speed, Vult, in Figure R301.2(2) equals or exceeds 140 miles per hour (225 kph) in a special wind region. Exceptions: For concrete construction, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Sections R404 and R608. For structural insulated panels, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Section R610. For cold-formed steel light-frame construction, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Sections R505, R603 and R804. In regions where wind design is required in accordance with Figure R301.2.1.1 or where the ultimate design wind speed, Vult, in Figure R301.2(2) equals or exceeds 140 miles per hour (225 kph) in a special wind region, the design of buildings for wind loads shall be in accordance with one or more of the following methods: AWC Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM). ICC Standard for Residential Construction in High-Wind Regions (ICC 600). ASCE Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE 7).

For any given wind direction, the exposure in which a specific building or other structure is sited shall be assessed as being one of the following categories: Exposure B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger.

R309.3.6.2.2,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Calculation Procedure,"Determination of the required size for water distribution piping shall be in accordance with the following procedure:Step 1—Determine PsupObtain the static supply pressure that will be available from the water main from the water purveyor, or for an individual source, the available supply pressure shall be in accordance with Section R309.3.5.1.Step 2—Determine PLsvcUse Table R309.3.6.2(1) to determine the pressure loss in the water service pipe based on the selected size of the water service.Step 3—Determine PLmUse Table R309.3.6.2(2) to determine the pressure loss from the water meter, based on the selected water meter size.Step 4—Determine PLdDetermine the pressure loss from devices other than the water meter installed in the piping system supplying sprinklers, such as pressure-reducing valves, backflow preventers, water softeners or water filters. Device pressure losses shall be based on the device manufacturer's specifications. The flow rate used to determine pressure loss shall be the rate from Section R309.3.4.2, except that 5 gpm (0.3 L/s) shall be added where the device is installed in a water service pipe that supplies more than one dwelling. As an alternative to deducting pressure loss for a device, an automatic bypass valve shall be installed to divert flow around the device when a sprinkler activates.Step 5—Determine PLeUse Table R309.3.6.2(3) to determine the pressure loss associated with changes in elevation. The elevation used in applying the table shall be the difference between the elevation where the water source pressure was measured and the elevation of the highest sprinkler.Step 6—Determine PspDetermine the maximum pressure required by any individual sprinkler based on the flow rate from Section R309.3.4.1. The required pressure is provided in the sprinkler manufacturer's published data for the specific sprinkler model based on the selected flow rate.Step 7—Calculate PtUsing Equation 29-1, calculate the pressure available to offset friction loss in water-distribution piping between the service valve and the sprinklers.Step 8—Determine the maximum allowable pipe lengthUse Tables R309.3.6.2(4) through R309.3.6.2(9) to select a material and size for water distribution piping. The piping material and size shall be acceptable if the developed length of pipe between the service valve and the most remote sprinkler does not exceed the maximum allowable length specified by the applicable table. Interpolation of Pt between the tabular values shall be permitted.The maximum allowable length of piping in Tables R309.3.6.2(4) through R309.3.6.2(9) incorporates an adjustment for pipe fittings. Additional consideration of friction losses associated with pipe fittings shall not be required.",,,,,
