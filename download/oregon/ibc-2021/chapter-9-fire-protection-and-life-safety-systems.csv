9,,Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems,"About this chapter: Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipment systems to perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the International Fire Code®.",Wall|Door|Slab,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Residential (R)|Institutional (I),sd|dd|cd,fire_protection_alarm_systems,fire_protection_engineer
