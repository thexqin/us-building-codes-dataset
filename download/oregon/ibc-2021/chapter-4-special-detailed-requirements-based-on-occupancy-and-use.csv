The product listing in Table 435.3.7 does not specifically include packaging, and the packaging material includes Group A plastics. FIGURE 435.3.8(1) EVALUATION OF CARTONED COMMODITIES CONTAINING GROUP A PLASTICSa,b This figure is used to determine the commodity classification of a mixed commodity with Group A plastics in a package or carton, or on a pallet. The following is an example of how to apply Figure 435.3.8(1): A pallet load consists of a Class III commodity with components of unexpanded Group A plastic and packing material of expanded Group A plastic. Using Equation 4-2, the weight of unexpanded Group A plastic is 5 percent. Using Equation 4-3, the volume of expanded Group A plastic is 15 percent. This commodity is classified as a Class IV commodity. If the volume of the expanded Group A plastic is increased to 20 percent, the classification changes to a high-hazard commodity.

It is not applicable to transportation of explosives or any handling or temporary storage necessary or incident thereto. It is not intended to apply to bombs, projectiles or other heavily encased explosives. Storage in excess of 300,000 pounds of explosive materials in one magazine is not allowed. Where a manufacturing building on an explosive materials plant site is designed to contain explosive materials, such building shall be located with respect to its proximity to inhabited buildings, public highways and passenger railways based on the maximum quantity of explosive materials permitted to be in the building at one time. Where two or more storage magazines are located on the same property, each magazine shall comply with the minimum distances specified from inhabited buildings, railways and highways, and, in addition, they should be separated from each other by not less than the distances shown for separation of magazines, except that the quantity of explosives in detonator magazines shall govern in regard to the spacing of said detonator magazines from magazines containing other explosive materials. Where any two or more magazines are separated from each other by less than the specified separation of magazines distances, then two or more such magazines, as a group, shall be considered as one magazine, and the total quantity of explosive materials stored in such group shall be treated as if stored in a single magazine located on the site of any magazine in the group and shall comply with the minimum distances specified from other magazines, inhabited buildings, railways and highways.

A separation distance of 100 feet is required for buildings of other than Type I or Type II construction as defined in this code. For earth-covered magazines, specific separation is not required. Earth cover material used for magazines shall be relatively cohesive. Solid or wet clay and similar types of soil are too cohesive and shall not be used. Soil shall be free from unsanitary organic matter, trash, debris and stones heavier than 10 pounds or larger than 6 inches in diameter. Compaction and surface preparation shall be provided, as necessary, to maintain structural integrity and avoid erosion. Where cohesive material cannot be used, as in sandy soil, the earth cover over magazines shall be finished with a suitable material to ensure structural integrity. The earth fill or earth cover between earth-covered magazines shall be either solid or sloped, in accordance with the requirements of other construction features, but not less than 2 feet of earth cover shall be maintained over the top of each magazine. To reduce erosion and facilitate maintenance operations, the cover shall have a slope of 1 vertical to 2 horizontal.
