1,,Scope and Administration,"User note:About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of this code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Sections R101—R102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections R103—R114). Section R101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable. Standards and codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section R102.4).The one- and two-family dwelling code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document, and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the building official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner.",BuildingElementProxy,Residential (R),concept|sd|dd|cd|ca,occupancy_classification,architect

Unless required by law, matters generally not authorized for inclusion in a specialty code or referenced standard include, but are not limited to: licensing or certification requirements, or other qualifications and standards for businesses or workers; structures or equipment maintenance requirements; matters covered by federal or state law; and matters that conflict with other specialty codes or publications adopted by the department. OAR 918-008-0000 to 918-008-0070 provides the process for adopting and amending the state building code that is consistent across all program areas. The state building code is derived from the most appropriate version of base model codes, which are updated periodically. The Oregon specialty code amendment process begins approximately midway into a code cycle. An appropriate advisory board approves or forwards the adoption of the Oregon specialty code and amendments to the Department for adoption.

The sole cause of action for a tort committed by officers, employees or agents of a public body acting within the scope of their employment or duties and eligible for representation and indemnification under ORS 30.285 or 30.287 is an action under ORS 30.260 to 30.300.
