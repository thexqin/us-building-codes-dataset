Work on nondamaged components that is necessary for the required repair of damaged components shall be considered part of the repair and shall not be subject to requirements for alterations. Devices or safeguards required by this code shall be repaired in accordance with the edition of code under which the device or safeguard was installed. To determine compliance with this subsection, the building official shall have the authority to require a building or structure to be reinspected. Work on nondamaged components necessary for the required repair of damaged components shall be considered a part of the repair and shall not be subject to the requirements for alterations.

Where it becomes necessary to repair all or a portion of a legally existing building that has been damaged by a cause outside of the control of the building owner, including but not limited to fire, wind, flood, earthquake and other similar damage where, prior to the damage, the legally existing building did not contain unsafe conditions, the building may be reconstructed exactly as it existed prior to the damage, where the requirements of this subsection are met. Structural repairs shall comply with the requirements of Section 405. Where unsafe conditions existed prior to the damage occurring, the building may be reconstructed as it existed prior to the damage provided the unsafe conditions are corrected, as determined by the building official.
