8,,Alterations—Level 2,Wall|Slab|Stair|Door|BuildingElementProxy,Business (B)|Assembly (A)|Residential (R),sd|dd|cd,special_construction,architect,"User notes:About this chapter: Like Chapter 7, the purpose of this chapter is to provide detailed requirements and provisions to identify the required improvements in the existing building elements, building spaces and building structural system when a building is being altered. This chapter is distinguished from Chapters 7 and 9 by involving space reconfiguration that could be up to and including 50 percent of the area of the building. In contrast, Level 1 alterations (Chapter 7) do not involve space reconfiguration, and Level 3 alterations (Chapter 9) involve extensive space reconfiguration that exceeds 50 percent of the building area. Depending on the nature of alteration work, its location within the building, and whether it encompasses one or more tenants, improvements and upgrades could be required for the open floor penetrations, sprinkler system or the installation of additional means of egress such as stairs or fire escapes."

Exceptions: Buildings of Group R occupancy with not more than five dwelling or sleeping units used solely for residential purposes where the altered building complies with the conventional light-frame construction methods of this code for new construction.

For purposes of this exception, ""roof"" shall mean the roof level above a particular story.
