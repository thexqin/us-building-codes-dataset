Any full-height wall length, or portion thereof, less than 4 feet (1219 mm) shall not be considered as a portion of the lateral force-resisting system, as shown in Figure 3114.8.5.3(2). All side walls or end walls used as part of the lateral force-resisting system shall have an existing or new boundary element on all sides to form a continuous load path, or paths, with adequate strength and stiffness to transfer all forces from the point of application to the final point of resistance, as shown in Figure 3114.8.5.3(3). The existing door interlocking mechanism shall not be considered as a component of the required load path. Where openings are made in intermodal shipping-container walls, floors or roofs, for doors, windows and other openings: The openings shall be framed with steel elements that are designed in accordance with Chapters 16 and 22. The cross section and material grade of any new steel element shall be equal to or greater than the steel element removed. A maximum of one penetration not greater than 6 inches (152 mm) in diameter for conduits, pipes, tubes or vents, or not greater than 16 square inches (10 323 mm2) for electrical boxes, is permitted for each individual 8-foot (2438 mm) length of lateral force-resisting wall. Penetrations located in walls that are not part of the lateral force-resisting system shall not be limited in size or quantity. Existing intermodal shipping container vents shall not be considered a penetration, as shown in Figure 3114.8.5.3(4). End wall doors designated as part of the lateral force-resisting system shall be intermittently welded closed around the full perimeter of the door panels.
