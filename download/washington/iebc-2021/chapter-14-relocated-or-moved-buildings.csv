These two codes, by their scope, are applicable to existing buildings. This is the case regardless of any repair, remodeling, alteration work or change of occupancy occurring (see the International Fire Code and International Property Maintenance Code).",BuildingElementProxy,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Factory and Industrial (F)|High Hazard (H),sd|dd|cd,special_construction,architect
