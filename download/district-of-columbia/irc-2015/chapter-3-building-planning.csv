R301.1,Chapter 3 Building Planning,Application,"Buildings and structures, and parts thereof, shall be constructed to safely support all loads, including dead loads, live loads, roof loads, flood loads, snow loads, wind loads and seismic loads as prescribed by this code. The construction of buildings and structures in accordance with the provisions of this code shall result in a system that provides a complete load path that meets the requirements for the transfer of loads from their point of origin through the load-resisting elements to the foundation. Buildings and structures constructed as prescribed by this code are deemed to comply with the requirements of this section.",Wall|Column|Beam|Slab|Footing,Assembly (A)|Business (B)|Educational (E)|Factory and Industrial (F)|Residential (R),sd|dd|cd,structural_design,structural_engineer
