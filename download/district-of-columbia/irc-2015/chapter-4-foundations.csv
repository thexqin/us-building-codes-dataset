The index was computed over a 12-month period (July-June) for each of the 3,044 stations used in the above analysis. Dates from the 1951-80 period were fitted to a Weibull probability distribution to produce an estimate of the 100-year return period. FIGURE R403.3(2)AIR-FREEZING INDEX AN ESTIMATE OF THE 100-YEAR RETURN PERIOD For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm. See Table R403.3(1) for required dimensions and R-values for vertical and horizontal insulation.
