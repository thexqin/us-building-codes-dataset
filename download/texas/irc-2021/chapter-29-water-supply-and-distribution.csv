29,,Water Supply and Distribution,"User notes: About this chapter: Many plumbing fixtures require a supply of potable water. Other fixtures could be supplied with nonpotable water such as reclaimed water. Chapter 29 covers the requirements for water distribution piping systems to and within buildings. The regulations include the types of materials and the connection methods for such systems. This chapter regulates the assemblies, devices and methods that are used for the prevention of backflow of contaminated or polluted water into the potable water system. Also contained in this chapter are the design requirements for the installation of fire sprinkler systems, as such systems are connected to the potable water supply for the building. Storm water and some liquid waste from a building can be a source of nonpotable water that can used to reduce the volume of potable water supplied to the building. This chapter provides the requirements for storage, treatment and distribution of this resource. This chapter also regulates the piping systems for reclaimed water supplied by a wastewater treatment facility.Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IRC—Mechanical/Plumbing Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.",,,,,
